    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_p01">We are now eight months prior to the public launch of the msnbc.com campaign. The team at SS+K and Catherine Captain from msnbc.com have studied their customers. They have spent a considerable amount of time breaking down their prospective audience into segments. They have begun to identify where the competition is positioned and where there may be opportunities to serve a segment of customers better.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_p02">Now the work <em class="emphasis">really</em> begins. We must devise a strategy for this campaign. This will lead us into establishing our overall marketing strategy, and more specifically the strategy to position msnbc.com in this crowded marketplace.</p>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_p04"><em class="emphasis">No false starts</em>: “If this didn’t go well, there would be no more marketing as msnbc.com.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_p05">When Catherine Captain left her job as <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>’s Director of Marketing Research in April 2006 to become the VP-marketing for msnbc.com, she declared, “I have left the number one print newspaper in the country to join the number one online news site in the country. Who could ask for more?”</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_p06">The aptly named Captain did ask for more—quickly, for she realized that a rapidly changing online news industry was threatening the market dominance msnbc.com had enjoyed for over a decade. Within less than a year of assuming her new post, Captain had requested and secured a $7 million marketing budget and had chosen strategic communications firm SS+K to oversee development of the online news giant’s first marketing campaign. <em class="emphasis">Catherine’s challenge was clear</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_p07"><em class="emphasis">Planning Is Everything</em>. Although it’s tempting to just jump in and create some cool commercials, in reality the advertising you see or hear is just the tip of the iceberg. As Catherine at msnbc.com knows all too well, there are plenty of competitors out there who also can do cool advertising. Devising a strategy requires careful thought about your strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the only thing we can count on is that things change: a company must take stock of its environment and monitor what consumers think of it over time so it can anticipate changes instead of waiting to be surprised by them. By the time changes take place, it’s too late to react to them effectively. So, by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A detailed plan that specifies overall objectives the client wishes to reach based upon a realistic assessment of its environment and what it is capable of achieving, as well as its general approach to reaching those objectives.</span></span> we mean a detailed plan that specifies overall objectives the client wishes to reach based upon a realistic assessment of its environment and what it is capable of achieving, as well as its general approach to reaching those objectives.</p>

Brands have been around for centuries. Early craftsmen put their marks on their wares to identify who made them, and artists have long signed their artwork. Since that time, however, branding has expanded well beyond just differentiation through marks and logos. Modern brands such as Apple, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, and Wal-Mart now communicate meaning through attributes such as accountability, consistency, and even personality traits that their names have become associated with. These meanings translate to monetary value for the firm because their brand names acquire value—consumers willingly pay a premium to buy a product carrying a respected brand name as opposed to a similar product that carries an unknown brand name.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Characteristics of a Solid Branding Strategy</h2>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Accountability</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01">Brands impose a sense of accountability on the maker of a product. If you buy an Acme shoe and it performs poorly, you’re unlikely to buy Acme shoes again. On the other hand, if you’ve had a good experience with Acme, you’re likely to buy its shoes again and perhaps its socks, shirts, or golf clubs as well. In this way, the brand is a shorthand way of signaling quality that simplifies decision making for customers. People who know and like a given brand are more likely to buy it again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s02">

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s02_p01">Brands don’t have to be high end to command loyalty; they just need to communicate a consistent meaning to consumers. That might mean projecting an image of quality, but it can also mean being associated with consistently low costs (e.g., Wal-Mart), trendy fashion (e.g., Juicy Couture), or a particular lifestyle (e.g., Whole Foods Market). A brand thus serves to express key properties of the products the company produces.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating a Corporate Image</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s02_p01">Corporations often engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">image advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Campaigns aimed at enhancing a corporation’s image and promoting the company’s public identity rather than selling a specific product.</span></span> to enhance the public perception of the firm in the eyes of its most important constituencies—typically the firm’s customers, employees, and local communities. Although these campaigns aim to promote the company’s public identity rather than sell a specific product, a corporation’s image is intimately tied to its brand personality. The image of the firm reflects on the image of its brands.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s02_p02">In 2007, for example, Dow Chemical Company allocated over $25 million for a corporate ad campaign it called “the human element.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn08_001">Rance Crain, “Dow’s Corporate Ads Have Great Chemistry, but Will Respect Follow?” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, August 6, 2007, 13.</span> The campaign was meant to appeal to local communities (who may or may not welcome Dow into their backyards), as well as legislators, journalists, environmentalists, employees, and shareholders. The idea behind the campaign is to show what the “human element” can do to solve some of the world’s problems, such as countering climate change and providing clean water, decent housing, health, safety, and an affordable and adequate food supply. Dow’s goal for the campaign is “to be acknowledged as the largest, most profitable, and most respected chemical company in the world.” Its CEO, Andrew Liveris, will consider the campaign a success “when a Dow employee in a bar anywhere in the world can tell the guy next to him where he works and get the response, ‘Oh, Dow. That’s good.’”</p>

As Roger Adams, senior vice president–CMO of Home Depot, said, “If you go to a grocery store or department store, there are brands on the shelf that have fundamentally the same function and one is 20 percent more than the other one. But people are paying that because there’s a belief in the brand or there’s an experience with the brand that builds trust, or they know if there’s a problem they can get service, that type of thing. And people do it every day.…That’s pretty much what brand marketing is about.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_p01">Before you can decide where to go, you need to understand where you are (the current marketing situation or environment). Use secondary and primary research as discussed in <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch07#solomon-ch07">Chapter 7 "Decide What You Can Afford to Say: msnbc.com Sets the Budget"</a> to inform your assessment of the full situation.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p01">A situation analysis begins with a review of the client’s industry and of the competitors vying for the consumer’s attention and dollars. For example, a situation analysis might reveal that some companies in the industry may not actually be competitors; buyers of Hyundais are unlikely to be buyers of BMWs as well. It may also reveal indirect competition in an industry. Southwest Airlines, for example, tries to price its airline tickets low enough to compete with buses and automobiles.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p02">msnbc.com understood its competitors to reach beyond just other online news sites such as CNN.com or NYTimes.com.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p01">The situation analysis also evaluates the potential customers (prospects) for your product. This might include estimating the potential population of customers, demographic changes (such as aging Baby Boomers), potential sales per customer, trends in willingness to pay, and so on. Note that for consumer goods companies, the “customer” may be either the end consumer or the retailer. Thus, Wal-Mart is a major customer for consumer goods companies like Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s03_p01">Finally, the situation analysis examines overall economic and environmental trends that may affect a company’s marketplace situation. Economic growth or recession affects total demand for a product. Fewer people buy expensive houses when companies are downsizing. Foreign exchange rates may change the costs or make the company more competitive in foreign markets because the dollar may be worth less in another country—as a result it costs more dollars to manufacture the product elsewhere. Changes in costs can affect both prices and profits. For example, a drop in technology costs might cause a company to lower the prices on the goods it produces, possibly reducing profits. By contrast, a rise in fuel costs might force a company like Delta Airlines to raise its prices; if the company can’t increase prices enough to make up for the additional costs, its profits will decline. Changes in the cultural environment also exert a huge impact on a company’s fortunes. For a news Web site like msnbc.com, for example, the number and types of people who visit the site is influenced by the penetration of Internet access in different areas, the lure of alternative online platforms like virtual worlds or even Twitter, and the number of people who begin to use their cell phones as their primary “screen.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p02">The story of Nortel, a telecommunications equipment maker, offers an example of the importance of a regular brand audit. Nortel was struggling during an industry downturn and an accounting scandal. Its chief competitor, Cisco Systems, had an advertising budget almost six times the size of Nortel’s. Nortel’s new chief marketing officer, Lauren Flaherty, decided it was time to undertake a global brand audit to get a feel for how customers, employees, and shareholders perceived Nortel and what the company needed to do to reshape its brand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p03">Before the audit, Flaherty met with marketing executives throughout the company to assess Nortel’s marketing communications capabilities, as well as the capabilities of its ad agency and public relations firm. “The first priority is to understand, by target audience, what is the communications challenge with each constituency,” she said. “We will create a very systematic blueprint for who we communicate with, how we communicate, and the whole marketing mix.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn08_002">Kate Maddox, “Nortel CMO Begins Global Brand” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, May 8, 2006, 3.</span> Nortel’s audit allowed the company to get a more realistic feel for its market position so that its advertising could more precisely communicate its value proposition.</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p05">On the surface, the marriage of Microsoft’s technology with NBC’s content looked like a happy one, but beneath the surface there was confusion. Many of msnbc.com’s people defined the brand based on their role at the organization. As discussed in the <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch05#solomon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Know Your Audience: SS+K Learns All About msnbc.com, Inside and Out"</a> section on research and the msnbc.com stakeholder interviews, the technology side of the organization (the people who make the site function) identified more heavily with Microsoft, while employees who worked on the news side identified more with the NBC brand. By defining the brand based on their roles at msnbc.com, they lacked a cohesive umbrella definition, and as a result the organization wasn’t yet able to articulate its meaning to the outside world. Additional points contributed to the lack of clarity:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>msnbc.com is laden with brands: MSNBC cable TV, specific NBC TV program brands like <em class="emphasis">The Today Show</em>, branded personalities like Brian Williams, and brands they do not own but host on the site, such as <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>. Add to this mix the connection to MSN, and there was plenty of complexity and confusion regarding just what msnbc.com consists of.</li>
                <li>MSNBC cable has run a distant third in the twenty-four-hour news channel race. As a result, it hasn’t endowed msnbc.com with the brand equity afforded its rivals like CNN and the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, which have strong cross-channel representation.</li>
                <li>The association with NBC News lends an important credibility and character to the site, but broadcast news channels in general have failed to attract users in large numbers to their Web versions. The success of msnbc.com hadn’t depended on drawing users to TV news online, and its future did not lie in repurposing broadcast news.</li>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p06">SS+K conducted a situation analysis for its client, msnbc.com. It was vital for the agency to understand how people thought about the news service—especially compared to its major competitors. What products did it deliver well? What kind of personality did it have? The documents below reflect some of the agency’s findings.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p07"><em class="emphasis">Identifying a competitive opportunity</em>. The picture was a bit muddy: although the marriage between Microsoft and NBC made the news service unique, there was confusion about the best way to tell the client’s story to consumers. Was the site about cutting-edge technology or unique content? Should it focus on breaking news or on in-depth feature stories?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p08">Further probing with consumer focus groups, however, revealed an opening. When asked to compare the client’s personality to other news Web sites, people described msnbc.com as more friendly, colorful, and younger—if the site came to life, they thought it would be the characteristics that popular news anchor Katie Couric represented. This was a more positive personality description than the groups gave for the serious demeanor of CNN.com (who would have characteristics of an Englishman) or of the nondescript Yahoo! + Google News (whose traits would be like a traffic cop!). As a result, msnbc.com saw an opportunity to position itself as <em class="emphasis">entertaining news</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p09">Further probing revealed that people regarded msnbc.com as less biased than other news sites—either to the left (CNN.com) or to the right (Fox News). Compared to CNN.com, people felt that msnbc.com offered more variety, emotion, and potential to discover interesting things. In other words, the competition provided plenty of information, but not content that excited the imagination. At last, here was an advantage SS+K could run with: let’s think of the core customer as a News Explorer who enjoys the experience of discovering and unearthing new pieces of news and information from what he or she reads.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s05_s01_p02">Proposing the Big Idea requires client agreement that the idea is right. Thus, both the advertising agency and the client must agree upon the final brief. The best briefs are written by account planners collaboratively with input from the client, account team, and creative director. One of the key functions of the SS+K brief is to come up with a single essential thought that summarizes the idea that will convince consumers to do what it is that the communication aims to do. Every agency has a proprietary brief template it uses to spell out the types of content it will need to include, such as specifying the audience, the product features, media placement ideas, and key point.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s05_s01_p03">Briefs provide a foundation that allows all decision makers to provide initial input and subsequently gauge how well the chosen communication ideas, from advertising to media and PR, stay true to the strategic plan. In this way, clients rely on creative briefs as much as copywriters and art directors do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s05_s01_p04">SS+K uses only one brief, and the creative director has input on that brief. Other agencies may use different briefs for different purposes depending on the needs of the client. For example, a retailer may have a brief for its national campaign, and other briefs for local ads that may have different emphases. It is important to remember that there is no standard brief across the advertising industry, but most of the information found on briefs is fairly similar.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s05_s01_p05">The first step in the SS+K brief is to use consumer and brand truths to establish the client’s noble purpose.

SS+K copywriter Sam Mazur was asked to capture the essence of the branding in a conceptual piece of work that is not an advertisement. This is a tricky proposition. If it is effective, the manifesto is a useful tool for explaining the thinking of the marketing team. On the other hand, if the piece generates too much enthusiasm, the agency may find itself in the position of trying to explain the difference between an expression of the brand and an advertisement for the brand.</p>

            <li>Have you seen the new Smart car? If you have, you are probably part of the buzz that has been heard recently about this new concept car that has made it to the streets. The car seats two, is available in three different models, and costs between about $12,500 and $17,000. The most significant fact about the Smart car is that it gets about forty-five miles per gallon. That fact alone has become central to Smart car’s initial introduction to the driving public. Has “small” finally become better than “large, extralarge, and supersize”? The manufacturer of the Smart car is betting on it. Investigate the Smart car. Once this is done, construct a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis for the Smart car. Evaluate the car’s likelihood of success.</li>
            <li>Is there a Chick-fil-A in your neighborhood? If there is, you’ve probably eaten at one of the fastest-growing food franchises in the southern United States (see <a class="link" href="http://www.chickfila.com">http://www.chickfila.com</a>). Chick-fil-A has a unique approach to running their business. Using the company’s Web site and search engines, your task is to investigate the Chick-fil-A organization in order to conduct a situation analysis. During your investigation be sure to comment on the perceived competitive situation, customer situation, and economics and costs that impact or affect the company and its industry. Once you have completed your situation analysis, conduct a brief brand audit of Chick-fil-A. What are your conclusions about Chick-fil-A and its business model? Discuss your audit and opinions with peers.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Digital Natives</h3>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s06_p02">Most young adults have had some experience with MySpace or other Web communication sites. Security issues aside, millions of people are communicating in previously unheard-of ways via the Internet. One area of concern, however, is how to protect younger communicators from the dangers of an open Internet. Many parents of preteens have banned them from popular more adult social networking Web sites. A relatively new social networking Web site, however, has been designed with the preteen in mind. Stardoll (<a class="link" href="http://www.stardoll.com">http://www.stardoll.com</a>) provides a mechanism for preteens to communicate and chat with other preteens via a “MeDoll” that can be dressed and accessorized from a long list of celebrity avatars.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s06_p03">Go to the Stardoll Web site and familiarize yourself with its components. Your challenge is create a <em class="emphasis">short creative brief</em> to promote this Web site. The objective of the communication is to attract more viewers and participants. Present your brief in class if time permits.</p>

            <li>Pick one of your favorite brands and summarize its history in the marketplace. As you research your favorite brand, comment on any brand strategies that you notice. Comment on your brand’s perceived brand personality, brand equity, and viability.</li>
            <li>Pick any brand and apply the summary benefits of branding to your choice. Remember to discuss the benefits of branding to both the buyer and the advertiser or maker of your brand.</li>
            <li>Pick any company and create a new product for them to manufacture. Following the guidelines in the chapter, create a situation analysis of the firm and of your new creation. Examine the differences between the two “situations.” Should the company make your product? Explain.</li>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s06_p04">According to information presented in the Digital Natives section, preteens and teens can go to a monitored Web site and participate in a communication community that is structured just for them. The Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.stardoll.com">http://www.stardoll.com</a>) advocates protection for its viewers and participants from controversial topics, visuals, and conversations that plague more adult-oriented Web sites.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s06_p05">One of the purposes of this Web site appears to be the protection of its young participants from more adult-oriented content and exploitation. Examine the Web site and its policies. From an ethical point of view, assess the Web site and its capabilities for protecting its visitors. Can the organization’s implied protection promise be delivered? Summarize your thoughts.</p>
