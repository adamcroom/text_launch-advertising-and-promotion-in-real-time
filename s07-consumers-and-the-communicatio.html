    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_p01">We are now twelve months from the launch of the msnbc.com campaign. The SS+K team needs to start thinking seriously about how it’s going to make consumers crave the msnbc.com brand of news. Before they can do that, however, they need to take a step back to understand how advertisers “talk” to customers—what works and what doesn’t, and what determines what works. This means we need to take a look at communications and break down a complicated process into simpler elements. Does it matter exactly what we say? Who says it? Where people get the message? How about others’ opinions—to what extent are our own preferences shaped (consciously or not) by what we believe others like or dislike? And, with the magical world of technology, how might the advertiser/consumer relationship evolve?</p>

The consumer may have given feedback to the source about the message (typically only indirectly, namely by buying the advertised product or service or not)—and of course she may have ignored it, just as people often do today—but the line of communication was clearly drawn. The producer called the shots and the message was <em class="emphasis">univocal</em> (one voice).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">A New Interactive, Nonlinear, Multivocal Communications Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s01_s02_p01">Flash forward to a more dynamic—and chaotic—picture. Today, advertising messages come from many sources simultaneously through different media that target different receivers (consumers, business partners, stockholders, even government officials). At the same time, receivers talk with one another and they may initiate their own communication with the sender, whether that organization wants to hear it or not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s01_s02_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">updated communications model</a><span class="glossdef">The interactive, nonlinear, and <em class="emphasis">multivocal communication</em> process prevalent in twenty-first-century advertising.</span></span> is interactive, nonlinear, and <em class="emphasis">multivocal</em> (many voices). In addition, consumers now may choose to opt out of listening to a particular message—they often get to decide which messages they see or hear, and when. In the old days, opting out meant getting up to make a sandwich when a TV commercial came on, but today many of us have a lot more control to determine what messages will appear for us to consider in the first place. For marketers, this <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">permission marketing</a><span class="glossdef">A strategy in which consumers (receivers) indicate (for example, by searching for a certain topic on the Internet) that they are interested in receiving a communication before the sender transmits the message.</span></span> strategy makes sense (even though some may be indignant that they’re losing control over the situation). The rationale is very simple: A message is more likely to persuade consumers who have agreed to listen to it in the first place.</p>

The point of advertising shouldn’t be to interrupt more people who don’t want to talk to us.” To be heard above the noise, advertisers should seek permission from people to tell their story and begin a private, personal conversation that revolves around mutual interest and respect.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_001">Quoted in “Expert Tells Marketers: To Be Memorable, Get Permission” <em class="emphasis">InformationWeek</em>, May 18, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199602077">http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199602077</a> (accessed May 18, 2007).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s01_s03_p01">If we understand the communications model, we appreciate how messages affect people, how people make purchase decisions, and what influences these choices. These issues can help advertisers understand why people accept some messages while they ignore others. After all, it’s frustrating to be ignored—but in the world of advertising it’s also expensive.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s01_s03_p02">We are used to thinking about communication as a one-way process that moves from a source who chooses what to say, how to say it, and where to say it to a receiver who either absorbs the message or not. That basic assumption is no longer valid in many cases, as consumers today become more proactive in the communications process. This creates many more interesting advertising possibilities, but it’s also harder to control the process once the inmates run the asylum.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Who</em> communicates the message (the <em class="emphasis">source</em>) has a big impact on whether a receiver will accept the message. You’re a lot more likely to download the latest Rihanna cut if your buddy recommends it than if you get the same advice from your kindly old uncle (unless he happens to be Jay-Z). The power of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">source effects</a><span class="glossdef">The interpretation and impact of a message often is influenced by who delivers it.</span></span>, in fact, underlies the millions that celebrities make when they agree to endorse products. Obviously, advertisers feel it’s worth the substantial expense to pay a movie star or athlete to associate themselves with a certain brand’s message. Indeed, the pairing of a well-known person with a product is hardly new: Mark Twain’s image appeared on packages of flour and cigars in the late 1800s, while Buffalo Bill Cody hawked Kickapoo Indian Oil and Elvis was the face of Southern Maid Doughnuts. What makes an effective source? The important characteristics are credibility and attractiveness.</p>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Source Credibility</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Source credibility</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which consumers perceive the source of a message as an expert who is objective and trustworthy.</span></span> means that consumers perceive the source (the spokesperson) as an expert who is objective and trustworthy (“I’m not a doctor, but I play one on TV”). A credible source will provide information on competing products, not just one product, to help the consumer make a more informed choice. We also see the impact of credibility in Web sites like eBay or Wikipedia and numerous blogs, where readers rate the quality of others’ submissions to enable the entire audience to judge whose posts are worth reading.</p>

        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Source Attractiveness</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Source attractiveness</a><span class="glossdef">The perceived social value of the source of a message—not just his or her physical appearance, but also personality, social status, or similarity to the receiver.</span></span> refers to the source’s perceived social value, not just his or her physical appearance. High social value comes partly from physical attractiveness but also from personality, social status, or similarity to the receiver. We like to listen to people who are like us, which is why “typical” consumers are effective when they endorse everyday products.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p02">So, when we think about source attractiveness, it’s important to keep in mind that “attractiveness” is not just physical beauty. The advertising that is most effective isn’t necessarily the one that pairs a Hollywood hottie with a product. Indeed, one study found that many students were more convinced by an endorsement from a fictional fellow student than from a celebrity. As a researcher explained, “They [students] like to make sure their product is fashionable and trendy among people who resemble them, rather than approved by celebrities like David Beckham, Brad Pitt or Scarlett Johansson. So they are more influenced by an endorsement from an ordinary person like them.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_002">Quoted in “Celebrity Ads’ Impact Questioned,” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, 27 February 2007, <a class="link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6400419.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6400419.stm</a> (accessed October 31, 2007).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p03">Still, all things equal, there’s a lot of evidence that physically attractive people are more persuasive. Our culture (like many others) has a bias toward good-looking people that teaches they are more likely to possess other desirable traits as well. Researchers call this the “what is beautiful is good” hypothesis.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_003">Karen Dion, Ellen Berscheid, and Elaine Walster, “What Is Beautiful Is Good,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> 24 (1972): 285–90.</span> Unfortunately, in many cases, while beauty is only skin deep, “ugly is to da bone.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_004">Some of the material in this chapter was adapted from Michael R. Solomon, <em class="emphasis">Consumer Behavior: Buying, Having and Being</em>, 8th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2008).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Is It Better to Be an Expert or Hot?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s03_p01">Is source attractiveness more important than source credibility? The answer depends on the product or service you sell.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s03_p02"><em class="emphasis">When to use credibility</em>. If the product is utilitarian and complex (that is, consumers may not know much about how to use it), then a credible expert will be the most effective at persuading people to buy the product or service.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s03_p03"><em class="emphasis">When to use attractiveness</em>. If, on the other hand, the item is simple to understand (like clothing) but has a high social risk (that is, we’re concerned about the impression we’ll make on others if we’re seen with this item) then an attractive source will be more persuasive.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s01_s03_p04">Sometimes you’re lucky enough to have a spokesperson who is both credible and attractive. This was the case for SS+K’s <em class="emphasis">pro bono</em> campaign for the United Nations peacekeepers when ads featured hunky UN messenger for peace George Clooney.</p>

A study by Mediamark Research Inc. found that humor is the element in advertising that most appeals to kids.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_005">Mark Dolliver, “Critical Beer Drinkers, Confident Eaters, Etc.” <em class="emphasis">Adweek</em>, January 8, 2007, 24.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s02_p04">Interestingly, even among products whose purchase you might expect to be more rationally driven, such as pharmaceuticals, consumers are persuaded more by words and pictures from people who have had good results using the drug. Having Mrs. Jones’s picture with the words “Acme Sleep gave me my first restful night in fifteen years!” turns out to be more persuasive. Indeed, a study that included television ads for seven of the top ten best-selling prescription drugs for 2004 found that 95 percent of them used a positive emotional appeal (such as a character who’s happy after taking the product).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_006">Alicia Ault, “Drug Ads Play on Emotions,” <em class="emphasis">Family Practice News</em>, February 15, 2007, 45; Steve Smith, “Mastering the Direct Appeal,” <em class="emphasis">Sleep Review</em> 8, no. 4 (2007): 54.</span></p>

To promote its latest line of chicken sandwiches, the Arby’s fast-food chain aired TV commercials that took direct aim at rivals McDonald’s and Wendy’s.

Framed against a familiar golden arches logo, he proclaims, “I propose that McDonald’s stops putting phosphates, salt and water into its chicken. Consider replacing your chicken, that is only about 70 percent chicken, with 100 percent all-natural chicken.” Board members break out in laughter. At the end of the spot, a voice-over chimes in: “Unlike McDonald’s, all of Arby’s chicken sandwiches are made with 100 percent all-natural chicken.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_007">Suzanne Vranica, “Arby’s TV Spots Play Game of Fast-Food Chicken,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, July 5, 2006, A16.</span> This messaging strategy is more common in the United States than in other cultures like Japan, where it is extremely rare because some people consider it a rather abrupt and even rude way to communicate.</p>

What’s part of the physical environment? Surroundings and decor, for example. Our arousal levels rise when we’re in the presence of others. This arousal can be positive or negative. Watching a funny movie is often more enjoyable in a full movie theater where everyone else is laughing, too. But if we feel uncomfortably crowded, we may put up our guard.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s02_s03_p02">Intangibles like odors and even temperature affect our ability and desire to listen to messages. Indeed, a growing number of marketers are counting on scents to turn into dollars as they invest in costly new technologies to create scented ads (a magazine ad with a scent strip costs four to eight times as much as an odorless version). Sure, we’re used to a bombardment of perfume smells when we open a fashion magazine, but today the boundaries have widened considerably. Kraft Foods promoted its new DiGiorno Garlic Bread Pizza with a scratch-and-sniff card (good to carry with you if you plan to encounter vampires). On behalf of its client the pay-cable Showtime network, TV Show Initiative (a unit of Interpublic Group) promoted the popular show “Weeds” by adding the scent of marijuana to strips in magazine ads.

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s03_p02">Communications often involves new ideas, new products, and new information. Whether people adopt a new idea or product depends on many factors. The communications model for advertising (discussed above) is affected by the forces that govern the <em class="emphasis">diffusion of innovation</em>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch04_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Diffusion Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s03_s01_p01">The Burger “King.” The GEICO gecko. “Bounty, the quicker picker upper.” “Where’s the beef?” The “swoosh.” Most of us are very familiar with these advertising characters and phrases—in fact, some days it seems everyone we know sends us the same hilarious YouTube clip to check out the latest spot. Did you ever wonder why a phrase you hear for the first time one day suddenly comes out of everyone’s lips a week later? How does this process work, and why should we care? The latter question is easy: Advertising depends on the transmission of information among members of a society to spread the word about new ideas, products, and services.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s03_s01_p02">A lot of cutting-edge advertising strategies depend on our willingness—and enthusiasm—to share information and ideas that appeal to us with others. Indeed, this is the backbone of <em class="emphasis">viral marketing</em>, which we’ll talk about in detail later—basically this term refers to a process where people pass on a phrase, a joke, a slogan, or perhaps a URL to their network of friends, who in turn pass it on to others until thousands or even millions of us see it (think about how often more than one friend or acquaintance sends you the same e-mail joke).

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s03_s02_p01">An idea spreads in much the same way as a cold or other virus (hopefully with more pleasant results). The process begins with a small group of people, and then if it’s appealing enough it spreads (diffuses) into a larger market. We define the “spreaders” in terms of the relative speed with which they pick up the new idea:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s01_p02">Advertisers can help consumers through the decision-making process. Some ads intend to create awareness that a need exists (it was an adman, not a doctor, who invented the term “halitosis” to describe bad breath!). Other ads provide information to facilitate information search and comparisons. Progressive Insurance, for example, lets customers shop online and compare prices among major competitors. The company does not promise to have the lowest price, but it makes clear what its price is in relation to the competition.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p01">Thinking, feeling, and doing can happen in any order. Psychologists originally assumed that we form attitudes through a fixed sequence of these three components: We first <em class="emphasis">think</em> about the object, then evaluate our <em class="emphasis">feelings</em> about it, and finally take <em class="emphasis">action</em>: Cognition → Affect → Behavior.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p02">Research evidence, however, shows that we form attitudes in different sequences based on different circumstances. If we’re not very involved in or don’t care much about a purchase, we may just buy a product on impulse or because we remember a catchphrase about it instead of carefully evaluating it in relation to other products. In that case, action precedes feeling and thought: Behavior → Affect → Cognition.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s01_s01_p03">Conversely, feelings—rather than thoughts—may drive the entire decision process; our emotional reactions may drive us to buy a product simply because we like its name, its packaging design, or the brand image that ads create. In this case, we see the product, have a feeling about it, and buy it: Affect → Behavior → Cognition.</p>

But there was bad news too: while most consumers who didn’t own a Subaru had heard of the company, very few had any strong emotional connections with the cars. In response, Subaru launched a new marketing campaign that targets car buyers who pass through three stages: the heart, the head, and the wallet. The heart stage emphasizes the love owners feel for their cars in ads that tell about taking meaningful trips together or bidding a sad farewell to an old Subaru before driving off in a new model. In the head stage, spots feature rational reasons why someone should buy a Subaru, such as the couple that decides they’d rather sell their boat than get rid of their Subaru. The final wallet stage focuses on (you guessed it) financial reasons to buy a Subaru, and this includes messages from local dealers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_017">Aaron Baar, “New Subaru Campaign Takes Aim with Cupid’s Arrow,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Daily</em>, April 28, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com">http://www.mediapost.com</a> (accessed April 28, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p01">As you can see, attitudes are complex. Because of this complexity, researchers use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multiattribute attitude models</a><span class="glossdef">Theory that consumers form attitudes about a product based on attributes of that product, their beliefs about those attributes, and the relative importance they assign to those attributes.</span></span> to explain them.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s01_s02_p02">The decision to purchase a car like an SUV offers a good illustration of how a multiattribute model affects purchase behavior. On the one hand, the styling and stance of a particular model might evoke feelings of power, confidence, and ruggedness. The vehicle’s high ground clearance and roomy back might be great for the consumer’s intended camping trips. On the other hand, the brand could make the consumer ill at ease—perhaps a friend had a bad experience with that car maker. And the more rational side of a consumer might balk at the high cost and poor gas mileage. Yet the vehicle looks great, so the consumer isn’t sure. And, regardless of his personal feelings about the vehicle, the consumer may also factor in social pressure: will his friends criticize him as a wasteful gas-guzzler if he buys an SUV instead of a compact hybrid? Will he buy or won’t he? The decision depends on how the buyer combines and weights these positive and negative attitude components. The suspense is killing us…</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s01_s03_p01">So what’s the bottom line for advertising—is it the gift or the wrapping that counts? The research helps us understand how to design the advertising message so that it has the most influence. If we advertise to consumers who are highly involved in the purchase decision-making process, then those consumers will primarily use their <em class="emphasis">thinking</em> to drive the decision. Therefore, strong, rational arguments (the “gift”) will be most persuasive for them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s01_s03_p02">On the other hand, consumers who are less involved will be more influenced by the “wrapping”—the images, sounds, and feelings they see or remember about the product.

Are you getting brainwashed by innocent-looking TV commercials that “order” you to buy a product? If you believe advertisers are doing their best to place “secret messages” all around you, you’re not alone. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Subliminal perception</a><span class="glossdef">Perception that occurs when the stimulus is below the level of the consumer’s awareness.</span></span> is a topic that has captivated the public for more than fifty years, despite the fact that there is virtually no proof that this process has <em class="emphasis">any</em> effect on consumer behavior. Another word for perceptual threshold is <em class="emphasis">limen</em> (just remember “the secret of Sprite”), and we term stimuli that fall below the limen <em class="emphasis">subliminal</em>. So subliminal perception (supposedly) occurs when the stimulus is below the level of the consumer’s awareness.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p02">A survey of American consumers found that almost two-thirds believe in the existence of subliminal advertising, and more than one-half are convinced that this technique can get them to buy things they do not really want.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_020">Michael Lev, “No Hidden Meaning Here: Survey Sees Subliminal Ads,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 3, 1991, D7.</span> They believe marketers design many advertising messages so the consumers perceive them unconsciously, or <em class="emphasis">below</em> the threshold of recognition. For example, several authors single out beverage ads as they point to ambiguous shapes in ice cubes they claim are actually women’s bodies or erotic words. Most recently, ABC rejected a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) commercial that invited viewers to slowly replay the ad to find a secret message, citing the network’s long-standing policy against subliminal advertising. KFC argued that the ad wasn’t subliminal at all because the company was telling viewers about the message and how to find it. The network wasn’t convinced—but you should be.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_021">Ron Ruggless, “2006 the Year in Review: Even as High Costs, New Regulations and Health Concerns Test Operators, Industry Moves forward with Innovative Products, Proactive Strategies and Big Business Deals,” <em class="emphasis">Nation’s Restaurant News</em>, December 18, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29087275_ITM">http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29087275_ITM</a> (accessed February 13, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p03">Like this KFC ad, most examples of subliminal advertising that people “discover” are not subliminal at all—on the contrary, the images are quite apparent. Remember, if you can see it or hear it, it’s <em class="emphasis">not</em> subliminal; the stimulus is above the level of conscious awareness. Nonetheless, the continuing controversy about subliminal persuasion has been important in shaping the public’s beliefs about advertisers’ and marketers’ abilities to manipulate consumers against their will.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p04">Although some research suggests that subliminal messages can work under very specific conditions, this technique has very little applicability to advertising even if we wanted to resort to it. For one, an advertiser would have to send a message that’s very carefully tailored to each individual rather than to a large audience. In addition, there are wide individual differences in threshold levels (what we’re capable of consciously perceiving); for a message to avoid conscious detection by consumers who have low thresholds, it would have to be so weak that it would not reach those who have high thresholds.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s02_s02_p05">However, a new study surely will add fuel to the long-raging debate. The researchers reported evidence that a mere thirty-millisecond exposure to a well-known brand logo can in fact influence behavior; specifically the study found that people who were exposed to a quick shot of Apple’s logo thought more creatively in a laboratory task (mission: come up with innovative uses for a brick) than did those who saw the IBM logo.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_022">Thomas Claburn, “Apple’s Logo Makes You More Creative than IBM’s,” <em class="emphasis">Informationweek</em>, March 19, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.Informationweek.Com/News/Internet/Showarticle.Jhtml?Articleid=206904786">http://www.Informationweek.Com/News/Internet/Showarticle.Jhtml?Articleid=206904786</a> (accessed March 19, 2008).</span> Apple will no doubt love the implication, but most other advertisers are too focused on efforts to persuade you when you’re aware of what they’re up to.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s03_s02_p02">According to this perspective, the feedback we receive as we go through life shapes our experiences. Similarly, we respond to brand names, scents, jingles, and other marketing stimuli because of the learned connections we form over time. People also learn that actions they take result in rewards and punishments; this feedback influences the way they will respond in similar situations in the future. Consumers who receive compliments on a product choice will be more likely to buy that brand again, but those who get food poisoning at a new restaurant are not likely to patronize it in the future.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_p01">The most exciting advertisement is worthless if it doesn’t make a reasonably lasting impact on the receiver. So, advertisers need to understand how our brains <em class="emphasis">encode</em>, or mentally program, the information we encounter that helps to determine how we will remember it (if we do at all). In general, we have a better chance of retaining incoming data we associate with other information already in memory. For example, we tend to remember brand names we link to physical characteristics of a product category (e.g., Coffee-Mate creamer or Sani-Flush toilet bowl cleaner) or that we can easily visualize (e.g., Tide detergent or Mercury Cougar cars) compared to more abstract brand names.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_025">Kim Robertson, “Recall and Recognition Effects of Brand Name Imagery,” <em class="emphasis">Psychology &amp; Marketing</em> 4 (Spring 1987): 3–15.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_p02">The encoding process is influenced by the type of meaning we experience from a stimulus. Sometimes we process a stimulus simply in terms of its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sensory meaning</a><span class="glossdef">Associations with a product or brand that come from concrete attributes we can perceive with the senses, such as color or shape.</span></span>, such as the literal color or shape of a package. We may experience a feeling of familiarity when, for example, we see an ad for a new snack food we have recently tasted. In many cases, though, we encode meanings at a more abstract level. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Semantic meaning</a><span class="glossdef">Symbolic associations consumers form with a product or brand.</span></span> refers to symbolic associations, such as the idea that NASCAR fans drink beer or that cool women have Asian-inspired koi designs tattooed on their ankles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_p03">Advertisers often communicate these kinds of meanings through a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">narrative</a><span class="glossdef">A message related in the form of a story.</span></span>, or story. For example, in 2006 SS+K created television spots for the New York Knicks basketball team that featured some of the biggest Knicks fans, including film director Spike Lee, talking about the current state of the team, as well as lifelong Knicks fans who share fond memories of past glories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_p04">Much of the social information we acquire gets represented in memory in story form, so constructing ads in the form of a narrative can be a very effective technique to connect with consumers. Narratives persuade people to construct mental representations of the information they view. Pictures aid in this construction and allow for a more developed and detailed mental representation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_026">Jennifer Edson Escalas, “Narrative Processing: Building Consumer Connections to Brands,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consumer Psychology</em> 14, nos. 1 &amp; 2 (2004): 168–80; Rashmi Adaval and Robert S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s01_p01">Psychologists distinguish among three distinct types of memory systems, each of which plays a role in processing brand-related information:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s01_l01">

This storage is very temporary; it lasts a couple of seconds at most. For example, a woman walks past the perfume counter in a department store and gets a quick, aromatic whiff of Brit for Women by Burberry. Although this sensation lasts only a few seconds, it is sufficient to allow her to consider whether she should investigate further. If she retains this information for further processing, it passes into short-term memory.</li>
                <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Short-term memory (STM)</a><span class="glossdef">Mental process that stores a limited amount of information we are currently processing for a limited time; analogous to working memory in a computer.</span></span> also stores information for a limited period of time, and it has limited capacity. This is similar to <em class="emphasis">working memory in a computer</em>; it holds the information we are currently processing. Our memories can store verbal input <em class="emphasis">acoustically</em> (in terms of how it sounds) or <em class="emphasis">semantically</em> (in terms of what it means). We store it when we combine small pieces of data into larger <em class="emphasis">chunks</em>. A chunk is a configuration that is familiar to the person and that she can think about as a unit. For example, a brand name like Glow by JLo can be a chunk that summarizes a great deal of detailed information about the product.</li>
                <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Long-term memory (LTM)</a><span class="glossdef">Mental process that allows us to retain and recall large amounts of information for a long period of time.</span></span> is the system that allows us to retain information for a long period of time.

This means we actively think about the chunk’s meaning and relate it to other information already in memory. Advertisers sometimes assist in the process when they devise catchy slogans or jingles that consumers repeat on their own. So, “don’t leave home without it,” “just do it,” or “let your fingers do the walking.”</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">How Do We Store Information in Memory?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s02_p01">It’s important to understand how we store all of the massive amounts of information we retain in our minds. Just like a really disorganized “filing cabinet from hell,” our memories about brands (not to mention everything else we know) are useless if we don’t know where to find them. Advertisers can structure their communication to make it more likely that subsequent messages will call up the knowledge of a brand we’ve already absorbed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s02_p02">A popular perspective on this process is an <em class="emphasis">activation model</em> of memory, which proposes that each incoming piece of information in LTM is stored in an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">associative network</a><span class="glossdef">Mental system that contains many bits of information we see as related and stores each incoming piece of information with other, related pieces.</span></span> that contains many bits of information we see as related. Each of us has organized systems of concepts relating to brands, manufacturers, and merchants stored in our memories; the contents, of course, depend on our own unique experiences.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s02_p03">Think of these storage units, or <em class="emphasis">knowledge structures</em>, as complex spider webs filled with pieces of data. Incoming information gets put into nodes that link to one another. When we view separate pieces of information as similar for some reason, we chunk them together under some more abstract category. Then we interpret new incoming information to be consistent with the structure we have created. This helps explain why we are better able to remember brands or merchants that we believe “go together”—for example, when Juicy Couture rather than Home Depot sponsors a fashion show.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s02_p04">A marketing message may activate our memory of a brand directly (for example, by showing us a picture of it), or it may do so indirectly if it links to something else that’s related to the brand in our knowledge structure. If it activates a node, it will also activate other linked nodes, much as tapping a spider’s web in one spot sends movement reverberating across the web. Meaning thus spreads across the network, and we recall concepts, such as competing brands and relevant attributes, that we use to form attitudes toward the brand. Researchers label this process <em class="emphasis">spreading activation</em>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s03_p02">Individual cognitive or physiological factors are responsible for some of the differences we see in retrieval ability among people.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_027">S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s05_s04_s03_p03">Not surprisingly, recall is enhanced when we pay more attention to the message in the first place. Some evidence indicates that we can retrieve information about a <em class="emphasis">pioneering brand</em> (the first brand to enter a market) more easily from memory than we can for <em class="emphasis">follower brands</em>, because the first product’s introduction is likely to be distinctive and, for the time being, has no competitors to divert our attention.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_029">Frank R.

<em class="emphasis">State-dependent retrieval</em>. We are better able to access information if our internal state is the same at the time of recall as when we learned the information.

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Familiarity</em>. Familiarity enhances recall. Indeed, this is one of the basic goals of marketers who try to create and maintain awareness of their products. However, this sword can cut both ways: Extreme familiarity can result in inferior learning and recall. When consumers are highly familiar with a brand or an advertisement, they may pay less attention to the message because they do not believe that any additional effort will yield a gain in knowledge.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_033">Eric J.

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s06_s02_s04_p03">For many years BMW’s advertising has emphasized its sophisticated engineering as it appealed to affluent car enthusiasts. Lately, however, the company is broadening its message to be one of innovation and independence, as it hopes to entice drivers who are more captivated by the style of a car’s interior than the engine that sits under the hood. In one ad, the company highlights the design for a glass-walled new factory in Leipzig rather than a car model. Its strategy is to appeal to what it calls “the idea class”: self-motivated architects, professionals, and entrepreneurs who value authenticity and independent thinking. They buy luxury cars, but they’re not car nuts.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s06_s02_s04_p04">Why the change? An internal study found that of the 1.9 million consumers who bought luxury cars in a recent year, 1.4 million didn’t even consider BMW. About six hundred thousand of those non–BMW purchasers said they were looking for a car that’s fun to drive. A BMW marketing executive noted that for the company, “that is low-hanging fruit.” Still, many of those buyers instead drove home a Saab, Infiniti, Acura, or Lexus. The new ads were created by GSD&amp;M/Idea City, BMW’s ad agency, to convince these people that the values of innovation and independent thinking run deep in the company’s corporate culture (presumably in contrast to larger automakers that aren’t as free to innovate). As this executive observed, “It should appeal to the idea class that we are independent, that we are free to do something.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_052">Quoted in Neal E.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s01_p01">Some advertisers say that advertising does travel from country to country. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that many cultures, especially those of industrialized countries, have become so homogenized that the same advertising will work throughout the world. By developing one approach for multiple markets, an advertiser benefits from economies of scale because it does not have to incur the substantial time and expense to develop a separate campaign for each culture.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_057">Theodore Levitt, <em class="emphasis">The Marketing Imagination</em> (New York: The Free Press, 1983).</span> The 2006 World Cup, which was broadcast in 189 countries to one of the biggest global television audiences ever, illustrates how a standardized approach looks. MasterCard ran ads that appeared in thirty-nine countries, so its ad agency came up with a spot called “Fever,” in which a hundred-odd cheering fans from thirty countries appear. There’s no dialogue, so it works in any language. At the end, the words, “Football fever. Priceless” appeared under the MasterCard logo.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_058">Aaron O.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p01">Other advertisers point to huge variations across cultures. They feel that each culture is unique, with its own value system, conventions, and regulations. This perspective argues that each country has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">national character</a><span class="glossdef">A set of behavior and personality characteristics distinctive to a certain country.</span></span>, a distinctive set of behavior and personality characteristics.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_059">Terry Clark, “International Marketing and National Character: A Review and Proposal for an Integrative Theory,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing</em> 54 (October 1990): 66–79.</span> An advertiser must therefore tailor its strategy to the sensibilities of each specific culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p02">At a basic level, the need to customize is a no-brainer: Consumers speak many different languages, and intended meanings in one tongue don’t always translate seamlessly to another. It’s unlikely that Bimbo, a popular Mexican bread brand, or Super Piss, a Scandinavian product to unfreeze car locks, would go over well in the United States.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p03">Advertisers have (for the most part) learned the hard way over the years to avoid obvious language gaffes.

In Spanish, a <em class="emphasis">fiera</em> is an ugly old woman and a <em class="emphasis">caliente</em> is slang for a streetwalker; <em class="emphasis">pinto</em> is Brazilian slang for “small male appendage.”</li>
                <li>Buick had to rename its LaCrosse sedan the Allure in Canada after the company discovered that the name comes awfully close to a Québécois word for masturbation.</li>
                <li>IKEA had to explain that the Gutvik children’s bunk bed is named “for a tiny town in Sweden” after German shoppers noted that the name sounded a lot like a phrase that means “good f**.” IKEA has yet to issue an explanation for a workbench it calls the Fartfull.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_061">Mark Lasswell, “Lost in Translation,” <em class="emphasis">Business</em> (August 2004): 68–70.</span>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p04">Language aside, there are many instances where cultural sensitivities vary widely, and advertisers that try to export their own symbolism to another country do so at their own peril. In China, an ad for Nippon Paint (a Japanese brand) caused an uproar; it showed a sculptured dragon unable to keep its grip on a pillar coated in smooth wood-coating paint. Dragons are potent symbols in China, and seeing one easily defeated by a Japanese product proved too much.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_062">“China Bans Offending Nike Advert,” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, December 6, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4072203.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4072203.stm</a> (accessed February 13, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s03_p01">So what’s the correct answer? Although it feels warm and fuzzy to state that people are people wherever you go, in practice the standardization perspective hasn’t worked out too well. One reason for the failure of global marketing is that consumers in different countries have varying conventions and customs, so they simply do not use products the same way. Kellogg’s, for example, discovered that in Brazil people don’t typically eat a big breakfast—they’re more likely to eat cereal as a dry snack.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s03_p02">True, some large corporations such as Coca-Cola have been pretty successful at crafting a single, international image. Still, even the soft drink giant must make minor modifications to the way it presents itself in each culture. Although Coke commercials are largely standardized, the company permits local agencies to edit them so they highlight close-ups of local faces.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_063">J. S. Hill and J. M. Winski, “Goodbye Global Ads: Global Village Is Fantasy Land for Big Marketers,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em> 58, no. 49 (1987): 22, 36.</span> In their product as well as their advertising, Coke modifies the flavors of its product based on the tastes of the locals. These flavors can be taste-tested at Coke Headquarters in Atlanta or World of Coke at Disney’s Epcot Center in Orlando.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s03_p03">For a standardized approach to work, it needs to appeal to consumers in each market that share a lot in common (other than perhaps language and allegiance to one soccer team or another). Two types of consumers are good candidates: (1) affluent people who are “global citizens” and who come into contact with ideas from around the world through their travels, business contacts, and media experiences; and (2) young people whose tastes in music and fashion are strongly influenced by MTV and other media that broadcast many of the same images to multiple countries.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Semiotics: What Does It All Mean?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p01">Advertising is about communicating meaning—but how do we know what something means? This question is not as obvious (or perhaps as crazy) as it seems. Very often we make sense of a word, phrase, or image because we’ve learned to associate extremely subtle cultural distinctions with it. For example (speaking of standardizing advertising across cultures), some Chinese companies use ancient pictograms to create new corporate logos that make sense both to native consumers and to potential customers elsewhere. The Chinese alphabet uses symbols that stand for the words they signify. For example, China Telecom’s logo features two interlocking letter Cs that together form the Chinese character for China but also represent the concept of “customer” and “competition,” the firm’s new focus. In addition, though, the symbol also resembles the horns of an ox, a hard-working animal. The software company Oracle redesigned its logo for the Chinese market by adding three Chinese characters that signify the literal translation of the word <em class="emphasis">oracle</em>, “writing on a tortoise shell.” The expression dates back to ancient China when prophecies were scrawled on bones. The California firm was enthusiastic about the translation because it conveyed Oracle’s core competency—data storage.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_064">Gabriel Kahn, “Chinese Characters Are Gaining New Meaning as Corporate Logos,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition</em>, July 18, 2002, n.a.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Semiotics</a><span class="glossdef">The field of study that looks at the relationship between signs and symbols and their role in assignment of meaning.</span></span> is the field of study that looks at the relationship between signs and symbols and their role in assignment of meaning. Advertisers turn to semiotics to help understand what meanings people assign to specific symbols. These may vary across taste cultures and geographies—a spokesperson in a dark business suit signifies one thing in New York City and another in Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p03">Why do they bother? Their goal is to create product names, brand names, logos, and visual images that people will naturally interpret as meaning something they hope to convey. For example, advertisers might use the image of a cowboy to signify rugged individualism. The challenge is to come up with continually fresh, new, distinctive images that still both carry the intended meaning and stand out in the clutter of ad images.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p04">This task gets interesting because on the surface many marketing images have virtually no literal connection to actual products. What does a green lizard have to do with an insurance company (GEICO)? How can a celebrity like Morgan Fairchild enhance the meaning of a store like Old Navy? Does supermodel Heidi Klum really eat at McDonald’s? A computer created the name Exxon—just what does that mean anyway?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s01_p01">From a semiotic perspective, every marketing message has three basic components: an <em class="emphasis">object</em>, a <em class="emphasis">sign</em> (or symbol), and an <em class="emphasis">interpretant</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">object</a><span class="glossdef">In semiotics, the product that is the focus of the message.</span></span> is the product that is the focus of the message (e.g., Burger King’s menu items). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sign</a><span class="glossdef">In semiotics, the sensory image that represents the intended meanings of the object.</span></span> is the sensory image that represents the intended meanings of the object (e.g., a funky “King”). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interpretant</a><span class="glossdef">In semiotics, the meaning derived about the object.</span></span> is the meaning derived (e.g., quirky, cool).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s01_p02">Signs relate to objects in one of three ways: They can resemble objects, be connected to them, or be conventionally tied to them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_065">Arthur Asa Berger, <em class="emphasis">Signs in Contemporary Culture: An Introduction to Semiotics</em> (New York: Longman, 1984); Charles Sanders Peirce, in <em class="emphasis">Collected Papers</em>, ed.

A lot of time, thought, and money go into creating brand names and logos that will clearly communicate a product’s image. The Nissan Xterra combines the word <em class="emphasis">terrain</em> with the letter <em class="emphasis">X</em>, which many young people associate with extreme sports, to give the brand name a cutting-edge, off-road feel.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s02_p01">One of the hallmarks of modern advertising is that it creates a condition of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hyperreality</a><span class="glossdef">The process of making real what is initially simulation or “hype.”</span></span>. This refers to the process of making real what is initially simulation or “hype.” In other words, advertisers create new relationships between objects and interpretants as they invent new connections between products and benefits, such as when they equate Marlboro cigarettes with the American frontier spirit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s02_p02">Over time, the true relationship between the symbol and reality is no longer possible to discern in a hyperreal environment. The “artificial” associations between product symbols and the real world may take on lives of their own. Fictional characters routinely cross over from make-believe to the real world—sometimes they even “endorse” other products, as when a talking Mrs. Butterworth’s syrup bottle shows up in a TV commercial for GEICO insurance.</p>

We need to understand the norms, beliefs, and practices of a culture in order to communicate with people who inhabit it. Many advertising messages relate to a culture’s myths and rituals; in some cases they create new ones. Because a culture is so complex, a major strategic question is how much a campaign needs to be customized to each individual country if it is involved in several markets. While some standardized approaches can be effective, overall it is best to take into account local differences to ensure that the meanings the campaign intends to communicate are what the audience receives. Successful execution in these situations requires attention to the semiotics, or meanings, of images and words that represent underlying values and properties.</p>
