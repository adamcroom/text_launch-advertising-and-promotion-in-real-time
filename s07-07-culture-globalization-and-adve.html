        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_p01">Since a country’s culture is so complex and integral to how we make sense of the world, advertisers constantly grapple with a Big Question: does advertising “travel” from country to country? There are two viewpoints on this important issue.</p>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Yes: Standardize for Greater Efficiency</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s01_p01">Some advertisers say that advertising does travel from country to country. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that many cultures, especially those of industrialized countries, have become so homogenized that the same advertising will work throughout the world. By developing one approach for multiple markets, an advertiser benefits from economies of scale because it does not have to incur the substantial time and expense to develop a separate campaign for each culture.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_057">Theodore Levitt, <em class="emphasis">The Marketing Imagination</em> (New York: The Free Press, 1983).</span> The 2006 World Cup, which was broadcast in 189 countries to one of the biggest global television audiences ever, illustrates how a standardized approach looks. MasterCard ran ads that appeared in thirty-nine countries, so its ad agency came up with a spot called “Fever,” in which a hundred-odd cheering fans from thirty countries appear. There’s no dialogue, so it works in any language. At the end, the words, “Football fever. Priceless” appeared under the MasterCard logo.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_058">Aaron O. Patrick, “World Cup’s Advertisers Hope One Size Fits All: Month-Long Tournament Sets Off Scramble to Reach Huge Global TV Audience,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, March 28, 2006, B7.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">No: Customize to Appeal to Local Tastes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p01">Other advertisers point to huge variations across cultures. They feel that each culture is unique, with its own value system, conventions, and regulations. This perspective argues that each country has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">national character</a><span class="glossdef">A set of behavior and personality characteristics distinctive to a certain country.</span></span>, a distinctive set of behavior and personality characteristics.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_059">Terry Clark, “International Marketing and National Character: A Review and Proposal for an Integrative Theory,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing</em> 54 (October 1990): 66–79.</span> An advertiser must therefore tailor its strategy to the sensibilities of each specific culture.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p02">At a basic level, the need to customize is a no-brainer: Consumers speak many different languages, and intended meanings in one tongue don’t always translate seamlessly to another. It’s unlikely that Bimbo, a popular Mexican bread brand, or Super Piss, a Scandinavian product to unfreeze car locks, would go over well in the United States.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p03">Advertisers have (for the most part) learned the hard way over the years to avoid obvious language gaffes. They often conduct <em class="emphasis">back-translation</em>, where a different interpreter retranslates a translated ad back into its original language to catch errors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_060">Shelly Reese, “Culture Shock,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Tools</em> (May 1998): 44–49; Steve Rivkin, “The Name Game Heats Up,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing News</em>, April 22, 1996, 8; David A. Ricks, “Products That Crashed into the Language Barrier,” <em class="emphasis">Business and Society Review</em> (Spring 1983): 46–50.</span> Still, mistakes do creep in:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>The Scandinavian company that makes Electrolux vacuum cleaners introduced the products in United States with this slogan: “Nothing sucks like an Electrolux.”</li>
                <li>When Parker marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico, its claim “It won’t leak in your pocket and embarrass you” came out as “It won’t leak in your pocket and make you pregnant.”</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Fresca</em> (a soft drink) is Mexican slang for “lesbian.”</li>
                <li>Ford also ran into problems in Latin markets. The company had to change the names for its Fiera truck and its Caliente and Pinto cars. In Spanish, a <em class="emphasis">fiera</em> is an ugly old woman and a <em class="emphasis">caliente</em> is slang for a streetwalker; <em class="emphasis">pinto</em> is Brazilian slang for “small male appendage.”</li>
                <li>Buick had to rename its LaCrosse sedan the Allure in Canada after the company discovered that the name comes awfully close to a Québécois word for masturbation.</li>
                <li>IKEA had to explain that the Gutvik children’s bunk bed is named “for a tiny town in Sweden” after German shoppers noted that the name sounded a lot like a phrase that means “good f**.” IKEA has yet to issue an explanation for a workbench it calls the Fartfull.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_061">Mark Lasswell, “Lost in Translation,” <em class="emphasis">Business</em> (August 2004): 68–70.</span>

            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s02_p04">Language aside, there are many instances where cultural sensitivities vary widely, and advertisers that try to export their own symbolism to another country do so at their own peril. In China, an ad for Nippon Paint (a Japanese brand) caused an uproar; it showed a sculptured dragon unable to keep its grip on a pillar coated in smooth wood-coating paint. Dragons are potent symbols in China, and seeing one easily defeated by a Japanese product proved too much.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_062">“China Bans Offending Nike Advert,” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, December 6, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4072203.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4072203.stm</a> (accessed February 13, 2009).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">How Local Do Ads Need to Be?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s03_p01">So what’s the correct answer? Although it feels warm and fuzzy to state that people are people wherever you go, in practice the standardization perspective hasn’t worked out too well. One reason for the failure of global marketing is that consumers in different countries have varying conventions and customs, so they simply do not use products the same way. Kellogg’s, for example, discovered that in Brazil people don’t typically eat a big breakfast—they’re more likely to eat cereal as a dry snack.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s03_p02">True, some large corporations such as Coca-Cola have been pretty successful at crafting a single, international image. Still, even the soft drink giant must make minor modifications to the way it presents itself in each culture. Although Coke commercials are largely standardized, the company permits local agencies to edit them so they highlight close-ups of local faces.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_063">J. S. Hill and J. M. Winski, “Goodbye Global Ads: Global Village Is Fantasy Land for Big Marketers,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em> 58, no. 49 (1987): 22, 36.</span> In their product as well as their advertising, Coke modifies the flavors of its product based on the tastes of the locals. These flavors can be taste-tested at Coke Headquarters in Atlanta or World of Coke at Disney’s Epcot Center in Orlando.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s02_s03_p03">For a standardized approach to work, it needs to appeal to consumers in each market that share a lot in common (other than perhaps language and allegiance to one soccer team or another). Two types of consumers are good candidates: (1) affluent people who are “global citizens” and who come into contact with ideas from around the world through their travels, business contacts, and media experiences; and (2) young people whose tastes in music and fashion are strongly influenced by MTV and other media that broadcast many of the same images to multiple countries.</p>

    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Semiotics: What Does It All Mean?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p01">Advertising is about communicating meaning—but how do we know what something means? This question is not as obvious (or perhaps as crazy) as it seems. Very often we make sense of a word, phrase, or image because we’ve learned to associate extremely subtle cultural distinctions with it. For example (speaking of standardizing advertising across cultures), some Chinese companies use ancient pictograms to create new corporate logos that make sense both to native consumers and to potential customers elsewhere. The Chinese alphabet uses symbols that stand for the words they signify. For example, China Telecom’s logo features two interlocking letter Cs that together form the Chinese character for China but also represent the concept of “customer” and “competition,” the firm’s new focus. In addition, though, the symbol also resembles the horns of an ox, a hard-working animal. The software company Oracle redesigned its logo for the Chinese market by adding three Chinese characters that signify the literal translation of the word <em class="emphasis">oracle</em>, “writing on a tortoise shell.” The expression dates back to ancient China when prophecies were scrawled on bones. The California firm was enthusiastic about the translation because it conveyed Oracle’s core competency—data storage.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_064">Gabriel Kahn, “Chinese Characters Are Gaining New Meaning as Corporate Logos,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition</em>, July 18, 2002, n.a.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Semiotics</a><span class="glossdef">The field of study that looks at the relationship between signs and symbols and their role in assignment of meaning.</span></span> is the field of study that looks at the relationship between signs and symbols and their role in assignment of meaning. Advertisers turn to semiotics to help understand what meanings people assign to specific symbols. These may vary across taste cultures and geographies—a spokesperson in a dark business suit signifies one thing in New York City and another in Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p03">Why do they bother? Their goal is to create product names, brand names, logos, and visual images that people will naturally interpret as meaning something they hope to convey. For example, advertisers might use the image of a cowboy to signify rugged individualism. The challenge is to come up with continually fresh, new, distinctive images that still both carry the intended meaning and stand out in the clutter of ad images.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_p04">This task gets interesting because on the surface many marketing images have virtually no literal connection to actual products. What does a green lizard have to do with an insurance company (GEICO)? How can a celebrity like Morgan Fairchild enhance the meaning of a store like Old Navy? Does supermodel Heidi Klum really eat at McDonald’s? A computer created the name Exxon—just what does that mean anyway?</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Components of Meaning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s01_p01">From a semiotic perspective, every marketing message has three basic components: an <em class="emphasis">object</em>, a <em class="emphasis">sign</em> (or symbol), and an <em class="emphasis">interpretant</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">object</a><span class="glossdef">In semiotics, the product that is the focus of the message.</span></span> is the product that is the focus of the message (e.g., Burger King’s menu items). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sign</a><span class="glossdef">In semiotics, the sensory image that represents the intended meanings of the object.</span></span> is the sensory image that represents the intended meanings of the object (e.g., a funky “King”). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interpretant</a><span class="glossdef">In semiotics, the meaning derived about the object.</span></span> is the meaning derived (e.g., quirky, cool).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s01_p02">Signs relate to objects in one of three ways: They can resemble objects, be connected to them, or be conventionally tied to them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_065">Arthur Asa Berger, <em class="emphasis">Signs in Contemporary Culture: An Introduction to Semiotics</em> (New York: Longman, 1984); Charles Sanders Peirce, in <em class="emphasis">Collected Papers</em>, ed.

A lot of time, thought, and money go into creating brand names and logos that will clearly communicate a product’s image. The Nissan Xterra combines the word <em class="emphasis">terrain</em> with the letter <em class="emphasis">X</em>, which many young people associate with extreme sports, to give the brand name a cutting-edge, off-road feel.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s02_p01">One of the hallmarks of modern advertising is that it creates a condition of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hyperreality</a><span class="glossdef">The process of making real what is initially simulation or “hype.”</span></span>. This refers to the process of making real what is initially simulation or “hype.” In other words, advertisers create new relationships between objects and interpretants as they invent new connections between products and benefits, such as when they equate Marlboro cigarettes with the American frontier spirit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s07_s03_s02_p02">Over time, the true relationship between the symbol and reality is no longer possible to discern in a hyperreal environment. The “artificial” associations between product symbols and the real world may take on lives of their own. Fictional characters routinely cross over from make-believe to the real world—sometimes they even “endorse” other products, as when a talking Mrs. Butterworth’s syrup bottle shows up in a TV commercial for GEICO insurance.</p>

We need to understand the norms, beliefs, and practices of a culture in order to communicate with people who inhabit it. Many advertising messages relate to a culture’s myths and rituals; in some cases they create new ones. Because a culture is so complex, a major strategic question is how much a campaign needs to be customized to each individual country if it is involved in several markets. While some standardized approaches can be effective, overall it is best to take into account local differences to ensure that the meanings the campaign intends to communicate are what the audience receives. Successful execution in these situations requires attention to the semiotics, or meanings, of images and words that represent underlying values and properties.</p>
