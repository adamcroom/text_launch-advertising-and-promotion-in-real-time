        <h2 class="title editable block">Recall and Recognition</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_p01">Executing advertising effectively requires that consumers notice the ad, recall the brand, and remember it favorably when they make a purchase decision. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Recall</a><span class="glossdef">Viewers can remember and retell the specific marketing messages to which they were exposed.</span></span> means that viewers can remember and retell the specific marketing messages to which they were exposed. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Recognition</a><span class="glossdef">Viewers recognize the brand or message when they see or hear it again.</span></span> means they recognize the brand or message when they see or hear it again, even if they can’t recite it from memory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Because marketers pay so much money to place their messages in front of consumers, they are naturally concerned that people will actually remember these messages at a later point. It seems that they have good reason to be concerned. In one study, fewer than 40 percent of television viewers made positive links between commercial messages and the corresponding products, only 65 percent noticed the brand name in a commercial, and only 38 percent recognized a connection to an important point.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_020">“Only 38% of T.V. Audience Links Brands with Ads,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing News</em>, January 6, 1984, 10.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_p03">Ironically, we may be more likely to remember companies that we don’t like—perhaps because of the strong negative emotions they evoke. In a 2007 survey that assessed both recall of companies and their reputations, four of the ten best-remembered companies also ranked in the bottom ten of reputation rankings: Halliburton Co., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and Exxon Mobil Corp. In fact, Halliburton, with the lowest reputation score, scored the highest media recall of all the sixty companies in the survey.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_021">Ron Alsop, “News, Ads Shape Corporate Images,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal Online</em>, January 31, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://online.wsj.com">http://online.wsj.com</a>, by paid subscription (accessed October 15, 2007).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_p04">Metrics related to recall and recognition ignite controversy even among agencies themselves. For example, Carat Insight uses recognition techniques rather than recall. Mary Jeffries, the agency’s head of evaluation, explains: “Most research techniques have relied on consumers’ ability to remember advertising messages and they then use this as a proxy for effectiveness. This means that media such as radio, outdoor, press, cinema and online suffer terribly, as they do not get recalled. Our belief is that ads can work even if you can’t spontaneously recall them. This is why [we] use a recognition technique, which is a more accurate measure of likely exposure to advertising than recall.” Carat Insight provides a service it calls integrated communications evaluation (ICE), which uses recognition techniques and statistical modeling to identify the relationship between media channels and creative executions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_022">“Marketing League Table,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing</em>, September 5, 2007, 35.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_p05">In contrast, Intermedia Advertising Group is a research firm that measures advertising effectiveness by monitoring the TV-viewing population’s ability to remember an ad within twenty-four hours. The firm assigns a <em class="emphasis">recall index</em> to each ad to indicate the strength of the impact it had. In one recent year, while ads with well-known celebrities like Britney Spears, Austin Powers, and Michael Jordan had very high recall rates, three of the top five most remembered ads starred another (and taller) celebrity: Toys “R” Us spokesanimal Geoffrey the Giraffe.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_023">Vanessa O’Connell, “Toys ‘R’ Us Spokesanimal Makes Lasting Impression: Giraffe Tops List of Television Ads Viewers Found the Most Memorable,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition</em>, January 2, 2003.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_p06">Under some conditions, these two memory measures tend to yield the same results, especially when the researchers try to keep the viewers’ interest in the ads constant.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_024">Richard P. Bagozzi and Alvin J. Silk, “Recall, Recognition, and the Measurement of Memory for Print Advertisements,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Science</em> 2 (1983): 95–134.</span> Generally, though, recognition scores tend to be more reliable and do not decay over time the way recall scores do.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_025">Adam Finn, “Print Ad Recognition Readership Scores: An Information Processing Perspective,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing Research</em> 25 (May 1988): 168–77.</span> Recognition scores are almost always better than recall scores because recognition is a simpler process and the consumer has more available retrieval cues.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_p07">Both types of retrieval play important roles in purchase decisions, however. Recall tends to be more important in situations in which consumers do not have product data at their disposal, so they must rely on memory to generate this information.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_026">James R. Bettman, “Memory Factors in Consumer Choice: A Review,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing</em> (Spring 1979): 37–53.</span> On the other hand, recognition is more likely to be an important factor in a store, where retailers confront consumers with thousands of product options (i.e., external memory cues are abundantly available), and the goal is simply to get the consumer to recognize a familiar package.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_027">Mark A. Deturck and Gerald M. Goldhaber, “Effectiveness of Product Warning Labels: Effects of Consumers’ Information Processing Objectives,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consumer Affairs</em> 23, no. 1 (1989): 111–25.</span></p>

All parties agreed that given the size of the audience and the budget, the expectation was not to convert a huge number of people but rather to articulate the brand to the target audience. Michelle Rowley and John Richardson led the research effort by enlisting a firm called Russell Research to conduct surveys before the launch and then again after the launch to be able to understand any changes. Catherine Captain’s research background also came in quite handy here, as all agencies worked together to set up the appropriate parameters.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">Other agencies maintain that above all, the ad must get noticed. And very creative ads do get noticed—they break through the clutter. Ads that win creative awards have twice the “stopping power” of regular non-award-winning ads. They get your attention. Moreover, award-winning ads create buzz. Even after two decades, people still talk about Apple’s “1984” ad.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p02">But, although they are more entertaining, creative ads also can confuse the very people they’re intended to persuade. Sometimes a clever ad can be too hip for its own good. Research on award-winning ads finds that consumers are more likely to say “I couldn’t tell what that brand had to do with what was said and shown.” This means that executions may require tweaks (which copy testing can guide) so that the ads are able to generate sales for the brand as well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_028">Charles Young and Larry Cohen, “Creative Awards vs. Copytesting,” <em class="emphasis">Quirk’s Marketing Research Review</em>, April 2004.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p01">Attention-getting ads are particularly valuable when the communication objective is to help launch a new brand by boosting awareness and generating buzz. Apple’s “1984” ad is a case in point; the classic spot elevated the Apple brand from simply a utilitarian message (how a computer makes you productive) to an icon representing an attitude and point of view. Before the breakthrough “1984” ad, Apple’s TV commercials used slice-of-life and problem-solution frameworks. The “1984” commercial—shown only during the Super Bowl—created huge buzz for its allegory and cinematic distinctiveness. It created a position for Apple as revolutionary, liberating—much more strongly than a recounting of Macintosh’s user-friendly features would have done.</p>

This figure represents less than half the recall rate recorded in 1965. We can explain this drop-off in terms of such factors as the increase of thirty- and fifteen-second commercials and the practice of airing television commercials in clusters rather than in single-sponsor programs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn11_034">“Terminal Television,” <em class="emphasis">American Demographics</em> (January 1987): 15.</span></p>

A typical thirty-second commercial will break down into about ten to thirty frames for viewers to evaluate.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creativity versus Safety</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s03_p01">Many creatives believe that testing a campaign will drain the creativity from the campaign—that the only messages audiences will “approve” will be those that are safe and predictable, and hence, boring. Advertising legend David Ogilvy, however, disagreed. Near the end of his career he commented, “Most creative people detest research, and I’ve never understood why.…In my day, I used research very often to give me the courage to run campaigns that were risky.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s03_p02">In fact, copy research can actually give you the evidence to go with a radical or risky idea that company executives might not have approved otherwise. Boring ads that don’t tell the consumer anything new aren’t very effective. The most effective ads are those that stretch the meaning of the brand in the mind of the consumer. That is, the consumer learns something new about the brand, or the ad pushes the frontier of the brand. An effective ad is neither too far removed from the brand nor too staid.</p>
        <div class="key_takeaways editable block" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch11_s02_s03_p03">The harsh reality is that consumers don’t remember the large majority of advertising messages they see or hear. And if they do recall an ad, this doesn’t mean they’ll associate the image with the brand. Even slight differences in the elements of an ad influence its effectiveness (for example, the colors or fonts in a print ad). Careful pretesting increases the odds that a message will accomplish its objective. Copy research provides evidence that your ad gets the audience’s attention and delivers a message that motivates the consumer to consider buying your product or service. Advertisers typically try to determine if people can recall an ad’s contents, or at least recognize it when they see or hear it again. Both measures have their supporters; overall recognition is used more widely. Novel or innovative ads are most effective when the objective is to create buzz or brand awareness, but more straightforward executions do a better job when the objective is to deliver information or move consumers from one well-known brand to another.</p>
