Marketing-related objectives are specific to the firm’s brands, customer segments, and product features. These might include “Grow sales of product X by 30 percent over the next twelve months” or “Increase market share among affluent consumers aged forty-five to sixty-five.” Samsung, for example, sells fourteen product categories in more than two hundred countries, which yields 476 category-country combinations. Samsung collects data systematically on each combination and uses that brand data to set better marketing objectives by country and product.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn08_003">Thomas Davenport and Jeanne Harris, “Competing with Multichannel Marketing Analytics,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, April 2, 2007, 16.</span></p>

Often, the advertising objectives are tied to the product’s life cycle. For example, trial is usually employed at the start of a product’s life cycle to encourage customers to try the product. A firm pursues continuity objectives when a product is mature in order to remind current customers to continue buying the product. Brand switching, or <em class="emphasis">switchback</em>, occurs at later stages of the life cycle—particularly the rejuvenation phase, when the company highlights new product features or lowers the price of the product.</p>

Colley stated that the process of achieving an advertising objective can be broken down into four phases:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s03_s03_s01_p01">The DAGMAR model states that <em class="emphasis">advertising objectives must be concrete and measurable</em>. That is, you want to have a precise statement of the message to communicate to the target audience and have a way to measure whether the intended message has been communicated properly. The measurement can be straightforward. For example, if your objective is that people perceive your product as the healthy alternative, you can measure the objective by asking shoppers whether they think your product is healthier than the competition.</p>
