    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_p01">Advertisers like msnbc.com face tough choices. An ever-growing portfolio of media offers the promise of reaching different consumers in different contexts and at different times. The tools available to us range from an 8.5-by-11-inch ad tacked to your classroom wall by one of your fellow students who wants to sell his used textbooks (good thing we don’t need those anymore in our new “Flat World!”) to a high-tech mystery game where thousands of people text, IM, or Twitter one another with clues to help each other figure out the message.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_p02">SS+K and msnbc.com were ready to start pairing the objectives of the campaign with tactics they would use to achieve these, so they engaged a partner agency called The Media Kitchen to help. The Media Kitchen is the media arm of creative shop Kirshenbaum Bond and Partners, which is owned by the holding company MDC Partners (which also owns the innovative ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky). The basic philosophy at The Media Kitchen is to evaluate the research and information about the target audience—the news consumers that SS+K has dubbed <em class="emphasis">News Explorers</em>—and then decide which vehicles fit best. The first thing TMK had to do was to obtain demographic and media usage information about the News Explorers in order to understand where SS+K could find them. Once the agency understood more about which media these people relied upon, its planner would be able to coordinate the campaign’s messages and make media choices to ensure that the right people would see or hear these messages. After all, if an ad plays in the forest and nobody hears it, is it an ad?</p>

They used this information to develop a profile of its target consumers and to match that profile with the target’s media habits. These are the criteria The Media Kitchen used to describe the News Explorer segment in the Simmons database.</p>

        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Newspapers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Information-dense ads</em>. Newspapers are well suited to deliver complex messages like pharmaceutical ads. The vehicle lets the advertiser present in-depth information at less cost than would be possible on TV or in linear media like radio or quick-glance billboards. What’s more, readers are used to getting in-depth information from the newspaper, so the ad fits into that style. The print ad provides room to present the information and provide all the supporting reasons. Also, the consumer can keep the print ad for future use or reference.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">Local</em>. Newspapers work well for local reach—you can target newspapers by region. This also lets you tie the ad to action. The local ad can tell consumers exactly where and when to get the product.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">Declining and aging readership</em>. On the other hand, newspaper circulation continues to fall as existing readers age and younger consumers choose to get their news from the Internet. Daily circulation decreased 2.1 percent and Sunday circulation fell 3.1 percent, according to the spring 2007 report from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p>

        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Magazines</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Specificity</em>. Magazines can be more finely targeted because many of them address readers who share very specific interests, such as <em class="emphasis">Cat Fancy</em>, <em class="emphasis">Guns &amp; Ammo</em>, or <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em>. Others attract a well-defined demographic readership; for example, airlines’ in-flight magazines boast an affluent audience. The median household income for adults who read United Airlines’ <em class="emphasis">Hemispheres</em> magazine or American Airlines’ <em class="emphasis">American Way</em> magazine is $147,000, according to Mendelsohn Media Research. The average reader of these magazines is a forty-five-year-old highly educated businessperson—someone very desirable for advertisers of technology, travel, and real estate products to reach. There’s a good chance many of these travelers will pick up the magazine at some point during the flight.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_001">Matthew Schwartz, “In-Flight Magazines Take Off for B-To-B; Advertisers Take Opportunity to Reach Captive Audience,” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, January 15, 2007, 3.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p02"><em class="emphasis">National reach</em>. Whereas newspapers are local, magazines have national or international reach. Some magazines, such as <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, also print regional editions to support regional demographic differences and more targeted advertising.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p03"><em class="emphasis">Multiple impressions per copy</em>. Magazines last longer than newspapers and are often passed from person to person (magazines often cite this number of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pass-along impressions</a><span class="glossdef">The number of times a magazine or other piece of media is passed from one person to another.</span></span> to justify charging higher prices to advertisers). The targeted nature of magazines, the good visual quality of their images, and the high credibility of the medium means that the ads are likely to reach and influence the right audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p04"><em class="emphasis">Long lead time</em>. On the other hand, the production and distribution schedules of magazines require months of lead time. A monthly magazine slated to stay on newsstands through the end of December may have been printed in early November with a deadline for ad copy in September. This reduces the medium’s flexibility to respond to market changes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p05"><em class="emphasis">High cost</em>. A general-audience magazine typically charges more than $100,000 for a full-page four-color ad. Costs can grow if the advertiser wants guaranteed placement (e.g., near an article with the same theme as the product) and even more for ads on the back cover or directly inside the cover page. Moreover, advertisers often need to buy ads in multiple magazines to reach a wide audience. Despite the costs, ad spending in consumer magazines increased 4.6 percent in 2006.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_002">Gregg Cebrzynski, “And Now a Definitive Statement on the Future of Marketing and Media: Who Really Knows?” <em class="emphasis">Nation’s Restaurant News</em>, April 9, 2007, 14.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Mass audience</em>. TV attracts mass audiences, and network TV is the highest-exposure medium every hour of the day, according to “The Middletown Media Studies: The Media Day,” a study of consumer media habits by Ball State’s Center for Media Design. At least 30 percent of the study’s participants were exposed to TV programming during the day, and at times as many as 70 percent were watching. The study also found that consumers watch TV and use the Internet more than ten times as often as they read newspapers and magazines.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_003">Gregg Cebrzynski, “Taking on the Media Circus,” <em class="emphasis">Nation’s Restaurant News</em>, July 9, 2007, 33.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">The leading medium and growing revenues</em>. Ad bloggers and ad experts have predicted the demise of traditional TV spots for years. Yet TV ad spending rose 5.3 percent in 2006, according to TNS Media Intelligence, and accounted for nearly 44 percent of all advertising spending in 2006. In addition, Nielsen Media Research reported that consumers spent more time watching conventional TV in 2006 than they did in 2005. They increased their viewing by twenty minutes a week. “Some people assume that in this digital era, somehow TV is not as important as it once was,” said <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em> editor Jonah Bloom. “Nothing could be further from the truth. Mass audiences are harder than ever to get together.…TV is set to become more measurable and even more relevant and even more important in the marketing landscape.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_004">Quoted in “What to Expect from This Year’s Upfront,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, May 14, 2007, S-18.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Aging viewers</em>. On the other hand, younger consumers spend less time watching TV, so this medium is steadily aging. Consumers younger than thirty-five spend more time on the Internet than they do watching TV, according to a study by New York-based Jupiter Research. This trend is only going to increase as more video content from sites like Hulu, YouTube, and iTunes migrates to online formats.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p05"><em class="emphasis">High cost</em>. TV advertisements have high production and placement costs. A thirty-second ad on a popular prime-time network program can cost $250,000 each time it runs. Companies also spend more to create, produce, and pretest TV ads. A-list celebrity spokespeople and high-end special effects add to the costs. It can cost 350,000 to create a professional thirty-second spot, although small business can often create ads for much less.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p06"><em class="emphasis">Ad-skipping</em>. Whether they take a bathroom break, hit the skip button on their TiVo, or turn to the Internet for a few minutes, consumers pay less and less attention to commercial breaks in the programs. Expensive thirty-second ads may be playing to almost no one. To combat this, advertisers are turning to <em class="emphasis">branded entertainment</em> such as inserting the product into the scenery, dialog, or plot of the show. We’ll talk about that important new trend later.</p>

        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s02">

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Cable offers specificity</em>. Whereas network TV attracts a mass audience, cable TV lets advertisers pick demographic segments. Companies can target women with ads on the Oxygen or Lifetime cable networks. Well-heeled male audiences tune in the Golf channel while a younger male demographic hangs out on channels such as Sci-Fi. The Food Network and Travel Channel represent natural choices for advertisers in those respective arenas.</p>

                <p class="para">The television plan that The Media Kitchen put together had a heavy push the first week of the launch on select cable networks: BBC America, Comedy Central, Discovery, ESPN, ESPN 2, Food Network, History Channel, and National Geographic.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p02"><em class="emphasis">Local distribution through cable</em>. Cable providers offer more targeted opportunities than do the national networks or even local broadcasters. Cable operators sell ad slots for local ads that can be targeted to specific sections of a city or even to specific neighborhoods. This lets the advertiser pay for the media impressions that matter.</p>

    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Radio</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Breadth</em>. Radio reaches 232 million listeners during the week, according to figures from Arbitron’s <em class="emphasis">RADAR 93 June 2007 Radio Listening Estimates</em>. Drive-time radio aimed at commuters remains popular with marketers. Conventional radio (as opposed to satellite radio and other subscription audio) continues to be the medium of choice for 75 percent of all drivers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s03_p02"><em class="emphasis">Local</em>. Smaller, local retailers use radio to keep their name top of mind. For example, Bishop’s Promart hardware store advertises on five radio stations in its Ithaca, New York, market area. On talk radio and easy-listening stations, the retailer runs ads it targets to more upscale customers and advertises grills and heaters. The store runs ads for house painting materials, however, only on country radio, because of its generally lower-income audience. “The upscale customer is probably going to hire out their painting. So we try to focus on people who are going to be doing it themselves,” explained Bishop’s Promart owner Forest Putney. Putney also gets involved in occasional promotional events, such as the annual backyard giveaway hosted by one of the local radio stations. He says it is a good opportunity to advertise in the community to maximize name recognition.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_005">Quoted in “Radio Ads Generate the Right Customer Frequency for Bishop’s,” <em class="emphasis">Hardware Retailing</em> 193, no. 4 (October 2007): 26.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s03_p03"><em class="emphasis">Cost effective</em>. Research has found that the best radio ads can have as much impact as the average TV ad, yet at a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s03_p04"><em class="emphasis">Shrinking listener base</em>. Although millions do listen to radio, the number is not growing. Cell phones and iPods compete for the ears of radio listeners, and other listeners are switching to commercial-free satellite radio. Then, too, even when people are listening to ads, they may not be paying attention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s03_p05"><em class="emphasis">Second-class citizen</em>. Another disadvantage of radio is that ad agencies see it as a medium of secondary importance and often assign their junior people to work on the campaigns. “There is a crisis in radio creativity within the world of full-service agencies,” said Stephen Donovan, the managing director of radio agency Radioville. “There tends to be an inherent snobbery towards the medium. Unless you’re lucky enough to have someone who loves radio working on your brief, it’s more likely it will get dumped with the junior creatives.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_006">Quoted in “Is There a Crisis in Radio Creativity?” <em class="emphasis">Campaign</em>, March 30, 2007, 19.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s04_p04">And now, some retailers can even follow you around the store to deliver more up-close and personal messages: A new technology called <em class="emphasis">RFID</em> (radio frequency identification) tracks customers as they make their way through the aisles.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s04_p05"><em class="emphasis">Highly contextual</em>. Out-of-home ads can be situated for maximum impact in terms of both whom the ad reaches and when it reaches them. To find health-conscious consumers, Jennie-O targeted health clubs. The company put ads in twenty-five hundred health clubs across the United States, locating them near water fountains and in locker rooms. Attention-getting headlines included “Make your pizza lean,” encouraging the use of turkey. The ads put the brand in front of exercising Americans—who frequently go to the grocery store after their workout.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s04_p06"><em class="emphasis">Reach</em>. Outdoor ads can be used to visually saturate an area at a relatively low price. 1-800-Flowers blanketed major metropolitan areas with ads for Valentine bouquets. “You couldn’t be in a city like New York without seeing it,” said Steven Jarmon, vice president of brand communication and partnership marketing for 1-800-Flowers.com.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_011">Quoted in “The Results Issue,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 28.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s04_p07"><em class="emphasis">Frequency</em>. Outdoor campaigns “interact with so many consumers at numerous touch-points during the day, which is important,” according to Jodi Senese, executive vice president of marketing at CBS Outdoor, New York. A month-long billboard might provide more than twenty exposures for daily commuters.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_012">Quoted in “The Results Issue,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 28.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s04_p08"><em class="emphasis">Short exposure duration</em>. Unfortunately, many forms of outdoor advertising only catch a few seconds of attention as people drive or pass by the ads. Such ads need a simple, engaging image and just a few words of copy. For example, 1-800-Flowers ads for “Happy Hour Bouquets” featured flowers arranged in vases shaped like margarita or martini glasses. The ads were so visual that they made an immediate impact. Results: Happy Hour sales grew 274 percent during the Valentine’s Day period, compared to Christmas (which is the third-largest selling season for flowers), prompting CEO Jim McCann to call the outdoor effort “[our] most successful floral campaign ever.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_013">Quoted in “The Results Issue,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 28.</span></p>

The actual audience of out-of-home advertising is hard to measure and hard to segment. The people who see an ad on the side of an urban bus might be homeless or they might be millionaires. Moreover, some people dislike out-of-home advertising, feeling that it creates visual clutter or gives them no escape from commercials.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sponsorships</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s05_p01">Some companies generate publicity by sponsoring an event, team, or sports arena. The company provides funding or some other material help to the event (such as food) in exchange for being mentioned as the event’s sponsor during the event and in the promotional material about the event.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s05_p02"><em class="emphasis">Large exposure</em>. Sponsorship provides large audience exposure and repeat brand impressions. Coors’ sponsorship of the NFL guarantees that the brand is mentioned numerous times during each game, along with a logo or brand image.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s05_p03"><em class="emphasis">Favorability by association</em>. The Coors deal lets the brewer use all NFL and team logos in its marketing. This transfers the goodwill of the fans from their sport to Coors. Coors hopes that fans will support the beer the way the company supports the sport.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s05_p04"><em class="emphasis">Lack of messaging</em>. Although sponsorship reminds viewers of the brand, it offers little opportunity to convey detailed brand messages or to present a unique selling proposition (defined below).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s05_p05"><em class="emphasis">High cost</em>. In 2005, Coors Brewing Co. signed a deal to pay $500 million over five years to be the official sponsor of the NFL, a 67 percent increase from its previous deal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s05_p06"><em class="emphasis">Clutter of competing sponsorships</em>. Coors might sponsor the NFL, but Pepsi’s name might be on the stadium while one of the teams is sponsored by Gatorade. Coors is the official sponsor of the league, but rival Anheuser-Busch has individual deals with twenty-eight teams at an estimated cost of $30 million annually. In other cases, the event sells so many sponsorships that no single sponsor gets much play.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s05_p07">In addition, there is always the pitfall of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ambush marketing</a><span class="glossdef">Advertising by companies who are not an official sponsor of an event but give the impression that they also are underwriting it.</span></span>: You pay a premium to be an “official sponsor” of an event, but your competitors advertise there as well and give the impression that they also are underwriting it. This is a big issue at the Olympics; for example, the 2008 Beijing Games had twelve global sponsors who together paid almost a billion dollars for bragging rights. China tried to crack down on other companies that used the five-ring logo or sold unauthorized versions of the mascot. These ambushes have a long history: at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, Nike placed advertisements near the stadiums and established a “Nike village” even though it was not an official sponsor. Visa Inc. sponsored the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer; American Express ran a campaign saying Americans did not need a “visa” to travel to Norway.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_014">Robert Woodward, “Olympic Sponsors Steeled for Ambush,” <em class="emphasis">Reuters</em>, June 4, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL2975740220080604">http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL2975740220080604</a> (accessed July 26, 2008).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Direct Response</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p01">Direct response methods are forms of communication addressed to specific recipients so that the sender can track whether or not the person took action after receiving the message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p02"><em class="emphasis">Segmentation and customization</em>. Extensive databases and lists mean that advertisers can pick who they want to contact and tailor the message to that group. Public and private commercial data sources let advertisers know and pick the audience. A direct marketer can know how much a consumer paid for their house (public land records), what kind of car they drive (motor vehicle records), and which clubs they belong to or charities they support (donor lists).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p03"><em class="emphasis">Immediacy</em>. Direct response offers just that—people can respond directly to the advertisers’ pitch by returning a reply card, saying yes to a telemarketer, or clicking a link on an e-mail.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p04"><em class="emphasis">High cost per impression</em>. Both direct mail and telemarketing have a high cost per impression due to physical production and labor costs, respectively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p05"><em class="emphasis">Intrusiveness</em>. Many consumers feel inundated by direct marketing and resent it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p06">Popular forms of direct response include:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p07"><em class="emphasis">Telemarketing</em>. Although the telephone offers the most interactive channel to reach consumers, many despise it for its intrusiveness. The fact that there are over 149 million phone numbers on the FTC’s National Do Not Call Registry, which has only existed since 2003, shows the breadth of the public’s dislike for getting unwanted sales calls in the middle of dinner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p08"><em class="emphasis">Direct mail</em>. Direct mail is tangible—people can hold it, interact with it, even smell it. New printing techniques support customization. Advertisers can also include physical premiums such as fridge magnets or software disks. But a full mailbox may mean that much of it is simply thrown away unopened. Worse, consumers are beginning to see mail as wasteful and bad for the environment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p09"><em class="emphasis">E-mail</em>. E-mail supports customization—a company can tailor each e-mail to each recipient.

E-mail, however, suffers from the taint of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spam</a><span class="glossdef">Unsolicited e-mail sent to multiple addresses; nine out of ten e-mail messages are spam.</span></span>.

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s01_s06_p10">General Motors is known for its TV ads and NFL sponsorship, but it also makes use of direct mail. For example, GM sent out five million personalized cards by mail to customers who’d bought GM cars between 1998 and 2004. The list of customers was generated from dealer databases. The card gave customers a $10 credit toward any needed repair. The campaign generated $15 million in revenue solely from the coupon-generated visits. On top of that was the incremental benefit: when people are getting their car repaired, they wander around the showroom and look at the new models. So the secondary effect of the cards is that one in a hundred people may decide to buy a new car while getting their old one repaired.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_016">“The Results Issue,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 28.</span></p>

Some advertisers are skeptical about the future of m-commerce because they feel that many consumers will resist the practice of seeing a lot of ad messages clog up their phones. One recent survey reported that only 18 percent of American respondents said they were receptive to the idea of watching ads in exchange for free mobile content. But 37 percent of Europeans like the idea.

To cash in the coupons, consumers show their cell phone screen that displays the coupon to a store cashier.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s03_p04">Getting a plug is nothing new. What is new, however, is that product placement has evolved from a practice of convenience (directors like to include actual products as props to enhance realism) to a deliberate and lucrative business practice. A typical placement deal between Staples and NBC illustrates how this works: when the office products retailer introduced a new paper-shredder called the MailMate in 2006, it engaged a company that specializes in placements to handle this part of its media strategy. The company made a deal with the producers of <em class="emphasis">The Office</em> to include the product in two episodes of the hit show. In one show, the character Kevin Malone shreds paper with the MailMate; in the second, the character Dwight Schrute leaves the company and takes a job at Staples. To emphasize the small size of the paper shredder, it sat on Kevin’s desk. To show how sturdy it is, he shredded his plastic credit card with the device. And the episode closed with Kevin shredding lettuce to make a salad; when a colleague asked where he got the salad, he replied, “Staples.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_029">Stephanie Clifford, “Product Placements Acquire a Life of Their Own on Shows,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 14, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a> (accessed July 14, 2008).</span> Nothing subtle about that placement.</p>

The Fox affiliate in Las Vegas made a deal that gets news anchors to sit with cups of McDonald’s iced coffee on their desks during the news-and-lifestyle portion of their morning show. Is this a conflict of interest? According to the account supervisor at the ad agency that negotiated the deal, “If there were a story going up, let’s say, God forbid, about a McDonald’s food illness outbreak or something negative about McDonald’s, I would expect that the station would absolutely give us the opportunity to pull our product off set.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_031">Quoted in Stephanie Clifford, “A Product’s Place is on the Set,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 22, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a> (accessed July 22, 2008).</span> What do you think—does this form of product placement cross the McLine?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s04_p02">The problem with ads in commercial games is that many players are too immersed in the game to notice them. For that reason, advertisers such as Burger King create <em class="emphasis">purpose-built advergames</em>. These types of games use the advertiser’s branded mascots, themes, and venues to make the brand a key element of the game. Purpose-built advergames “let you have complete control over your brand message since you’re the one making the game,” said Darren Herman, the cofounder of IGA Worldwide. “But the biggest problem with advergames is in their distribution. Most companies don’t have the resources of, say, a Burger King, to do that correctly. For every successful advergame—like Burger King’s—there’s a ton of failures, usually due to distribution. How do you get your game out there and who do you get it to?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_032">Quoted in Paul Hyman, “Burger King Has It Their Way with Advergame Sales,” <em class="emphasis">Hollywood Reporter</em>, February 7, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/features/columns/playing.../e3i19a1b95e867baa55b5c3c3c6d5061b53">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/features/columns/playing.../e3i19a1b95e867baa 55b5c3c3c6d5061b53</a> (accessed February 10, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s04_p03">Herman raises a valid point, but videogames seem poised to become a distribution platform in their own right. As gaming becomes more of a mainstream activity, we can expect to see more advertising targeted to players. While many media planners still have a stereotype of a typical gamer as a greasy-haired teenager who eats a lot of cold pizza, the reality is that 40 percent of gamers are women, and the average age of game players is thirty-five. And 65 percent of American households play computer and video games.</p>

This is becoming an important piece of the marketing puzzle.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_033">Quoted in Robert Levine, “Planned Guns N’ Roses Deal Underscores Power of Video Games to Sell Songs,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 22, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a> (accessed July 22, 2008).</span></p>

To identify the spark that ignited the fire of buzz marketing, perhaps we need look no further than to <em class="emphasis">The Blair Witch Project</em>, a horror movie that was made for $22,000 and earned $248 million at the box office. How did this low-budget production pull this off? The answer is the buzz campaign that began long before the film was released. While the story of a group of young people who get massacred in the woods was fiction (sorry to burst the bubble), the producers cleverly perpetuated the idea that the movie was a true documentary.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Virtual Worlds</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p01">The Internet has spawned numerous virtual worlds in which people take the form of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">avatars</a><span class="glossdef">Digital representations of people.</span></span> (digital representations of themselves) as they play, interact, and virtually live in an online space. Some communities, such as Linden Lab’s Second Life, mimic real life with 3-D graphics that give people a chance to live a different identity (or several) online. Many users choose elaborate characters, either fantasy figures or idealized men or women with exaggerated “attributes.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p02">Numerous companies have set up shop in one or more of these virtual worlds. In some cases (as in advergaming) they simply advertise their product on virtual billboards. For example, billboards in Second Life advertise the Honda Acura RDX. Clicking on the billboard gives the user a virtual copy of the car that they can drive around Second Life and even use in racing games in the online world. In other (typically more successful) cases the brand becomes part of the world, as when avatars who receive virtual Nikes actually get the ability to run faster in the virtual world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p03">Currently well over a hundred virtual worlds are operating live or are in development. The research firm Gartner predicts that by the year 2011, over 250 million people will be involved in these immersive digital environments. U.S. firms spent an estimated $15 million on advertising in virtual worlds in 2006. This figure is expected to reach $150 million by 2012.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p04">To date, virtual worlds have received a lukewarm reception by advertisers. Some early campaigns fizzled because they failed to generate interest among virtual world inhabitants—simply putting up a billboard just won’t do it for most avatars. In other cases, disappointed clients didn’t see the kinds of numbers they are used to getting from real-world campaigns that might touch millions of people. This platform is still in its infancy, so many consumers don’t even know yet that it exists.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p05">This is a very short-sighted perspective: virtual worlds will most likely continue to mature and evolve into a major media platform over the next five or ten years. Major media companies, including MTV Networks and Disney, continue to invest millions of dollars as they develop their own virtual worlds. Media planners who doubt the staying power of these platforms need look only to the next generation of consumers, who already are logging serious time in their own virtual worlds. Habbo Hotel (based in Finland) targets thirteen- to eighteen-year-olds and boasts over 100 million registered users worldwide and over 8.5 million unique users each month. Gaia Online attracts more than 2 million unique visitors each month; $300,000 of the members log in for an average of <em class="emphasis">two hours</em> <em class="emphasis">per day</em>.

In a twist to the old practice of using customer testimonials, companies are giving customers the power and the tools to make their own ads, a phenomenon known as consumer-generated media (CGM). The rise of PC video and image editing tools means that millions have the ability to create content. For example, snack-maker Doritos posted media clips online for consumers to tweak and make a commercial for the product, with the winning commercial being aired during the Super Bowl. The company received over a hundred entries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_036">Sonia Reyes, “Packaged Foods” <em class="emphasis">Adweek</em>, April 30, 2007, SR19.</span></p>

Since our target has a very keen bull** meter…it gives a different perspective on McDonald’s, making it seem [less] corporate,” said Chris Arnold, creative director for Arnold Worldwide, who handles some McDonald’s work in New York and purchased the rights to make the video into a spot for McDonald’s.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_037">Quoted in “The Results Issue,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 28.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_p03">But what if some ads insult the brand? When Chevy let consumers make ads about its new Chevy Tahoe, some consumers created ads attacking the large SUV’s gas-guzzling ways. But Chevy didn’t remove the negative submissions, because it showed that the brand could take a good-natured teasing and stay open to customer’s opinions. Besides, everyone knows there are trolls on the Internet, so negative content is often ignored.

Upon logging on to the site, <a class="link" href="http://www.dewmocracy.com">http://www.dewmocracy.com</a>, players are sent to a virtual world, where they are invited to join one of three teams. A video lays out a vision of a world where corporate profits rule over all; players need to fill a “magic gourd” (i.e., a bottle) to “restore the soul of mankind.” Players move into different chambers, where they select the flavor of their drink, its color and marketing characteristics. The gamers eventually will be given the opportunity to persuade the company to produce their drink in the real world. An executive boasted, “To the best of our knowledge, a brand has never given consumers this much control. We felt that the best way to fully engage consumers would be to give them the power to create a new product.”</p>

Although many marketers may have theories about what <em class="emphasis">should</em> work, the nature of new media means that these theories largely are untested. Consumer acceptance, response, and cost effectiveness can all be unknown.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_s04_p02">Privacy issues, combined with the fact that consumers have only so much free time, also could damp the boom in social networking on the Web. “Nobody has 5,000 real friends,” says Tim Hanlon, senior vice president of Denuo Group, a media and advertising consulting firm owned by Publicis. “At the end of the day it just becomes one big cauldron of noise.” For marketers, he says, that will mean the sites will be much more effective as a consumer research tool than as a venue to peddle products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_050">Suzanne Vranica, “Ad Houses Will Need to Be More Nimble; Clients are Demanding More and Better Use of Consumer Data, Web,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, January 2, 2008, B3.</span> Log onto your Facebook page to see what your friends have to say about <em class="emphasis">that</em>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_p04">Within the media agency, there are a few key people responsible for the planning and implementation of the campaign.

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_p05">During the <em class="emphasis">negotiation process</em>, rates can change based on how much the advertiser will commit to, how long they will commit the funds, and other factors that support the business relationship. One thing that comes out of this for the advertiser is “added value.” Added value can be additional pages or runs in a particular medium; it can also be a survey or access to a medium’s database.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_p06">A common place for these negotiations to take place is the media upfronts.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Market Coverage</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p01">Media vehicle choice is driven by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market coverage</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which a given media vehicle reaches the target audience.</span></span>, which is the extent to which a given media vehicle reaches the target audience. For example, local newspapers, radio stations, billboards, and direct mail campaigns are cost effective when they target a population that lives in a specific region, whereas national newspapers, TV, and online are better for nationwide campaigns. Specialized magazines and online media are particularly useful for target consumers who have specific interests. Online media also offers the advantage of real-time tracking—you know instantly whether consumers are clicking through to your site and how much time they spend at the site.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p02">Market coverage tells advertisers what a specific vehicle can do for them, but that doesn’t mean that any one vehicle can do the whole job. Often, a media plan requires multiple media to achieve the advertiser’s goals. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">media schedule</a><span class="glossdef">The planner’s best estimate of which media will be most effective to attain the advertising objective(s) and which specific media vehicles will do the most effective job.</span></span> outlines the planner’s best estimate of which media will be most effective to attain the advertising objective(s) and which specific media vehicles will do the most effective job.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p03">When she creates the media schedule, the planner considers factors such as the match between the demographic and psychographic profile of a target audience and the people a media vehicle reaches, the advertising patterns of competitors, and the capability of a medium to adequately convey the desired information. The planner must also consider factors such as the compatibility of the product with editorial content. For example, viewers might not respond well to a lighthearted ad for a new snack food during a somber documentary on world hunger.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p04">When she analyzes media, the planner assesses <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">advertising exposure</a><span class="glossdef">The degree to which the target market will see an advertising message in a specific medium.</span></span>, the degree to which the target market will see an advertising message in a specific medium. Media planners speak in terms of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">impressions</a><span class="glossdef">The number of people who will be exposed to a message that appears in one or more media vehicles.</span></span>, the number of people who will be exposed to a message that appears in one or more media vehicles. For example, if fifty million people watch <em class="emphasis">American Idol</em> on Fox, then each time an advertiser runs an ad during that program, it gets fifty million impressions (clue: that’s a lot). If the advertiser’s spot runs three times during the program, the impression count would be 150 million (even though some of these impressions would represent repeated exposure to the same viewers).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Reach</a><span class="glossdef">The percentage of the target audience that is exposed to any of the media vehicles in the media plan during a specified time period.</span></span> refers to the percentage of the target audience that is exposed to any of the media vehicles in the media plan during a specified time period. Choosing the media vehicle with highest reach means that more people will be exposed to the campaign. For example, if a media plan targets the roughly five million women who are eighteen to twenty-five years old, then a reach of fifty means that 50 percent, or 2.5 million, of the target audience will see at least one of the media vehicles in the media plan. Reach only counts viewers once. If a person sees the same ad multiple times in one medium, or even if they see the ad in different media, it still counts as only one person for the purposes of calculating reach.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p06">A related term, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency</a><span class="glossdef">The average number of times that target consumers are exposed to the media plan.</span></span>, refers to the average number of times that target consumers are exposed to the media plan. Frequency is important if the advertiser believes that consumers need multiple exposures to the campaign before buying the product or taking action. Achieving both broad reach and high frequency is very expensive—doubling the reach and doubling the frequency at the same time requires buying more than four times as many media impressions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p07">Say that a media planner wants to be sure her advertising for the Rockstar energy drink effectively reaches college students. She learns that 10 percent of the target market reads at least a few issues of <em class="emphasis">Wired</em> each year (that’s <em class="emphasis">reach</em>). She may also determine that these students on average are likely to see two of the ten ads that Rockstar will run in <em class="emphasis">Wired</em> during the year (that’s <em class="emphasis">frequency</em>). Now, she calculates the magazine’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gross rating points (GRPs)</a><span class="glossdef">A calculation made by multiplying reach times frequency.</span></span> by multiplying reach times frequency, which in this case allows her to compare the effectiveness of <em class="emphasis">Wired</em> to that of alternative media vehicles. By using this same formula, the planner could then compare this GRP number to that of another magazine or to the GRP she would get if she placed an ad on TV or sponsored a Maroon 5 concert tour on college campuses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p08">Although some media vehicles deliver superior exposure, they may not be cost efficient. More people will see a commercial aired during the Super Bowl than during a 3:00 a.m. rerun of an old Will Ferrell movie. But the advertiser could run late-night commercials every night for a year for the cost of one thirty-second Super Bowl spot. To compare the relative cost effectiveness of different media and of spots run on different vehicles in the same medium, media planners use a measure they call <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost per thousand (CPM)</a><span class="glossdef">Metric that reflects the cost to deliver a message to one thousand people.</span></span>. This figure reflects the cost to deliver a message to one thousand people. CPM allows advertisers to compare the relative cost effectiveness of different media vehicles that have different exposure rates.</p>

Television networks are concerned about the size of their audiences because their advertising rates are determined by how many viewers their programming attracts. Similarly, magazines and newspapers try to boost circulation (that explains all the free issues you get) so they can charge higher rates to their advertising clients.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p01">Size matters: ad space costs money, so advertisers think carefully about the size of ads. Larger or longer ads cost more but provide more in terms of space to tell a story and exposure to catch the consumer’s eye. A double-page magazine ad is more noticeable than a half-page ad. Short or small ads allow more frequency, more reach, or a longer campaign—an advertiser can afford to buy many more impressions in many more media vehicles with a small ad.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p02">Historically, TV advertisers only bought sixty-second spots. But allocating the budget to thirty-second or fifteen-second spots improves the advertiser’s reach. The company can reach more people and get a better reach frequency at a lower cost. Shorter spots may direct viewers to a Web site where they can get additional information. Still, sometimes longer is better. In radio, advertisers have found that longer ads work better than short ones: spots of forty-five seconds or more were more effective than shorter spots.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_052">Radio Ad Effectiveness Lab, “Radio Effectiveness and Execution,” March 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.rab.com">http://www.rab.com</a>, by paid subscription (accessed February 12, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p01">Often one vehicle can’t accomplish all the goals of the campaign. For instance, no single vehicle might have the market coverage needed for the desired reach. Or it may be too expensive to achieve the desired frequency. Furthermore, some media vehicles lack the needed reach, are too expensive for the desired frequency, or are not effective for some aspects of the campaign. TV is expensive but lets the advertiser tell a good story about a new product. Magazines and print can reach specific demographics and deliver persuasive information. Billboards and other out-of-home vehicles are cheap and provide the reach and frequency to strengthen brand awareness and remind consumers of the product.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p02">New media can stimulate buzz that spreads the message further. A recent report based on data from three thousand panelists in six major markets found that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multiplatform advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Technique that exposes consumers to the same ad message on multiple platforms.</span></span> increases reach over individual platform advertising in a nonadditive way; in other words, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p08">Media planning is the process of choosing one or more media vehicles to reach the target audience and achieve the message objectives. In most cases the best plan combines several media platforms to ensure that the message breaks through advertising clutter. Media planners assess the characteristics of different media including their cost and effectiveness to decide upon an optimal mix. They use standard measures such as reach and frequency to compare apples and oranges (e.g., TV and billboards), though the increasing use of new media makes this comparison more difficult because industry standards have not yet evolved.</p>

One company that is trying a unique approach to attract the fashion-conscious youth element is Xezo (see <a class="link" href="http://www.xezo.com">http://www.xezo.com</a> for information). This company specializes in solid silver watches and timepieces, writing instruments, and eyewear.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s04_p03">Assume that your advertising agency has just been hired by Xezo to develop a “new media” campaign that will extend beyond their present media choices (e.g., magazines and Web site). Review the “new media” options and recommend a “new media” plan for the company. Describe the target market that is the focus of your plan. What message do you think the company should use if they were to follow your recommendation? Discuss your “new media” plan and message with peers.</p>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s04_p04">Doing research on traditional and “new” media is not an easy task. How can advertisers and their ad agencies find up-to-date information on media rates and deadlines from media across the country? One of the most popular information sources for advertising professionals is <em class="emphasis">Standard Rate and Data Service (SRDS)</em>. According to information provided by the SRDS Web site, “The SRDS database of media and information is the largest and most comprehensive in the world.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s04_p05">Go to the SRDS Web site at <a class="link" href="http://www.srds.com">http://www.srds.com</a> and review the information provided. Choose one of the information sources provided and see what you can find on media rates. Be sure to check out the information directed to students and educators. Once you have completed your review, summarize how you might be able to use this resource to find information on media rates. Lastly, using a search engine, see what other data services might be available to investigate media rates. Review and then compare and contrast a few of the more interesting alternatives you found. How does SRDS stack up against its competitors?</p>

            <li>Go to your local newspaper’s Web site. Once there, assume that you are an advertiser seeking to place an advertisement with the paper. Attempt to find the advertising rates, size restrictions, availability of color, and any other useful information for placing an ad. Evaluate your search experience. Evaluate the attractiveness of the newspaper’s rates.</li>
            <li>Go to at least one television and two radio station Web sites.

Attempt to find the advertising rates, special advertising discounts, availability, market coverage, and demographic reached. Evaluate your search experience. Evaluate the attractiveness of the television and radio rates.</li>
            <li>Assume that you are applying for a marketing management job in direct marketing. The interviewer asks you the following questions: “If you were to take your list of friends, what would be the best way to reach them with a direct marketing message? How would you get their attention with the message?” The interviewer then says, “If you can be creative and answer my questions, you have a future in direct marketing.” Answer the interviewer’s questions and explain briefly what you have learned about direct marketing through this exercise.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Ethical Dilemma</h3>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s04_p06">As indicated in the chapter, “Product placement is also slowly but surely making its way into videogames. Advergaming brings real-world brands into the game.” On the surface this seems like a natural extension of product placements that we see every day in our TV programs, movies, and online surfing adventures. Adult gamers would think it unusual if the street scenes where high-speed chases and gun battles took place didn’t have billboards and signs that advertised real products. Should product placements in youth-oriented video games have stronger standards?</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s04_p07">Assume one of two roles: (a) You are a proponent of product placements in video games, or (b) You are an opponent of product placements in video games. Develop an effective argument for your position. Remember that your argument must address the ethics of using product placements in youth-oriented games. Discuss your argument with peers. Debate the opposition.</p>
