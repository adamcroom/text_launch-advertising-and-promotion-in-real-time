    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_p01">Good advertising is all about hitting customers where they live. But before you can craft a killer message to send, you have to know what address to send it to. Here’s a profound idea: <em class="emphasis">people are different</em>. A message that turns one person on may leave another cold. And, of course, not everybody’s likely to be interested in any idea, product, or service your client wants to sell (OK, maybe eternal youth…).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_p02">Before an advertiser can decide what a campaign should say, the advertiser needs to devote a lot of thought to identifying the target of the message. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Target marketing</a><span class="glossdef">The process of identifying the types of people who are most likely to want your product and then tailoring your efforts to satisfy their unique needs.</span></span> is the process of identifying the types of people who are most likely to want your product and then tailoring your efforts to satisfy their unique needs.

This task comes naturally to Michelle, who describes herself as a “failed actor” who fell into her job—and then fell in love with it. Michelle and her colleagues need to identify the most relevant audience for the msnbc.com branding message, get “under their skin,” and then figure out how to align their client with what these viewers want. That’s the segmenting, targeting, and positioning process in a nutshell.</p>

It’s crucial to slice up the pie so you can focus your resources on customers whose needs you have the best chance of satisfying. These are the benefits of a segmentation approach.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_p03">Segmenting the population gives you a concrete vision of your potential customer. For example, targeting upper-income unmarried men with a college education gives you a more specific vision of the intended audience than does simply advertising to “people.”</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_p04">Segmenting the population provides focus and specificity on those people most likely to buy your product. It’s better to find the five million people who are 80 percent likely to buy than it is to find the eighty million people who have a 5 percent chance of buying.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_p05">Segmenting the population lets you estimate the number of people in a given category (such as “Affluent Retirees”), which gives you an idea of your potential market size. Knowing how many potential customers you’ll have influences your sales estimates, your total marketing budget, and the advertising media you use. For example, if you’ll be targeting Hispanic consumers in Phoenix, your total market size will be 1.36 million people.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_001">Kevin Downey, “Phoenix: Ad Budgets Soar in Newly Ensconced 8th-Largest Latino Market, But Immigration Remains a Concern,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing y Medios</em>, October 22, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.marketingymedios.com/marketingymedios/market_profile/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003661213">http://www.marketingymedios.com/marketingymedios/market_profile/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003661213</a> (accessed November 5, 2008).</span></p>

While some product categories can move forward with demographic information only, services such as news, entertainment, and sports media need more information to fine-tune their targets. For example, the Bravo network, which has successfully created numerous high-style reality shows that revolve around upscale pursuits like gourmet cooking, fashion modeling, or home design, recently developed for advertisers a one-off (that is, one-time publication) magazine it called <em class="emphasis">Bravo Affluencer</em>. Each of the two people on the cover represented a distinct psychographic segment that is key to Bravo’s targeting strategy: an attractive man and woman, both in their late twenties, shopping bags and PDAs in hand, passports visible in pockets, dressed casually but stylishly. These two models are reminiscent of the popular stars of the sitcom <em class="emphasis">Will and Grace</em>—and that’s no accident. Bravo executives actually use the phrase “Will and Grace” to describe two of their key viewer segments: urban gay men and single female professionals. Many of the network’s most popular shows such as <em class="emphasis">Project Runway</em> and <em class="emphasis">Top Chef</em> attract these viewers in large numbers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_002">Susan Dominus, “The Affluencer,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Magazine</em>, October 30, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02zalaznick-t.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rsscc">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02zalaznick-t.html? partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rsscc</a> (accessed November 5, 2008).</span> As we learned in <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch05#solomon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Know Your Audience: SS+K Learns All About msnbc.com, Inside and Out"</a>, SS+K and msnbc.com had done significant segmenting and research to identify their target audience, the <em class="emphasis">News Explorer</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s03_p01">While demographics are useful, advertisers often need to slice and dice even further. Traditional demographic segments (such as gender, age, and income) provide only a rough estimate of the attitudes and desires of different groups, so marketers often give consumer groups labels that capture something about their lifestyles and motivations as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s03_p02">Imagine an advertiser that defines a segment as <em class="emphasis">recent moms</em>. This label implies that all women who have recently given birth are fairly similar and that they all will respond the same way to an advertising message—how accurate is that assumption? Bloomingdale’s Quotation, a store-within-a-store, instead calls its target market “yummy mummies.” These are women age thirty-five to forty-five who have gained weight after their babies but don’t want to look matronly. They are affluent, suburban, and casual yet fashionable. Bloomie’s research department provided further insight into the target customer: she thinks classic sportswear like Jones New York is too formal but contemporary sportswear like Juicy Couture is too young. The mom wants clothes that look pretty and feminine and have flair but offer a generous, not-too-tight fit.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_009">Elizabeth Woyle. “What Do 35-Year-Old Women Want?” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, April 2, 2007, 66.</span></p>

While demographics can divide people along specific (often quantitative) dimensions, psychographics captures the reasoning and emotion behind people’s decisions. This information also enables advertisers to capture the themes, priorities, and “inside meanings” that a specific taste culture identifies with. For example, Svedka Vodka targets urban party people who are out drinking until three o’clock in the morning three nights a week. This target market is irreverent, and Svedka’s ads speak their language. The ads feature futuristic imagery and lines like “Svedka says ‘thank you’ for making the gay man’s fashion gene available over the counter in 2033.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_010">Dan Heath and Chip Heath. “Polarize Me,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, April 2007, 59.</span></p>

An insightful and comprehensive target profile should enable the writers and art directors to imagine the target consumer so well, in fact, that the creatives can develop an empathic understanding of that consumer’s relevant needs and wants.

The carmaker’s Zen Estilo (Estilo means “style” in Spanish) sells for less than $8,000 and comes in eight colors, including “purple fusion,” “virgin blue,” and “sparkling olive.” For a more modern look, Suzuki gave the car a two-tone dashboard and a front grille design that makes the little car look like it is smiling.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s03_s01_p01">Remember that positioning doesn’t just mean what your target market thinks about your product. Rather, it’s about how she thinks about it relative to competitors’ products—your product is less expensive, performs better, or fits better with the customer’s lifestyle. Positioning often relates to a brand’s strategic objectives. Looking back at our previous discussion of behavioral segmentation, the advertiser might think about potential customers in terms like these:</p>

<em class="emphasis">Value</em>: The product reaches price-sensitive customers by being low cost. An example would be Wal-Mart’s “Every Day Low Prices.” Companies often create <em class="emphasis">subbrands</em> to create distinctive positioning for the brand based on price. The Gap, for example, is a mid-price clothing store, while its sister company Banana Republic is a higher-priced clothing store, and Old Navy is the value-priced offering. Similarly, Volkswagen’s Skoda brand is known as the low-cost car brand.</li>

For example, Chanel is a designer-led luxury brand. The company has identified a new group of customers it wants to target. Chanel calls the group “new wealth”—women who have acquired a significant amount of money at an earlier age than previous generations. These women, with a net worth of over $1 million, have more cutting-edge fashion tastes. When Chanel CEO Maureen Chiquet strategizes about launching a new perfume to appeal to this customer segment, her watchword is exclusivity. “Let’s not be thinking about how big we can make this,” she tells her team, “but how exclusive and special you can keep it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_022">Robert Berner, “Chanel’s American in Paris,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, January 21, 2007, 70–71.</span>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s03_s02_p01">The average Buick buyer is a man in his midsixties—not the type of consumer inclined to trick out his car with twenty-two-inch wheels, a lowered suspension, and tinted windows. That’s why it’s a bit of a shock to check out a Buick Lucerne with those modifications on display at a party hosted by General Motors that also featured actress Vivica Fox, known for roles in movies like <em class="emphasis">Booty Call</em> and <em class="emphasis">Soul Food</em> and hip-hop star Jay-Z.

How with planning you need to use the research to build your case, but ultimately there is a small leap of faith you make in the end when you definitively place your stake in the ground about the strategic direction. How it’s so important for planners to be curious about things in life in general, not just in advertising, and how that curiosity comes from getting out there and living life, from talking to people and most importantly by reading, reading, reading.</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s03_s02_p13">Positioning your product or service to appeal to the needs of a specific group can set it apart from competitors that are also vying for the same consumers. A client’s product or service can be positioned relative to the competition along such dimensions as lifestyle, reasons for use, or quality/price tradeoffs. SS+K identified a target segment it called the News Explorer as the best prospect for its client. The typical user is a news junkie who enjoys the thrill of hunting for new information and who wants to dive into the information rather than just scan it. The agency will proceed to develop a brand message that emphasizes how msnbc.com delivers what News Explorers want.</p>

                <p class="para">What is one of the most potent political forces that any political candidate for national office must impress and deal with? If you said AARP, you are correct. If, as an advertiser, you don’t know what AARP is, you will be missing the network organization used by millions of seniors in the United States. (See <a class="link" href="http://www.aarp.org">http://www.aarp.org</a> for more information.) AARP is not just for retired persons anymore. The organization accepts members and offers benefits beginning at age fifty. Given the number of Baby Boomers at this age and beyond, AARP will have a growing market base for a number of years.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s04_p02">Seniors in the United States have become an important market target for many product and service producers. Advertisers are learning new ways to reach and communicate with this market. Seniors today don’t see themselves as old. Baby Boomer seniors see themselves as active, fashion conscious, energetic, adventurous, and knowledgeable about products and services directed toward their market segment. Seniors ride motorcycles, go skydiving, enjoy cruises, listen to concerts from bands popular when they were in their twenties, enjoy entertaining, and like to dress well. Sounds like a great opportunity for the enterprising marketer—right?</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s04_p03">Investigate the senior market, Baby Boomers, and the AARP for more information. Once you have completed this task, list the segmentation variables (beyond the age segmentation variable) that advertisers should use to more narrowly focus marketing and advertising efforts toward this market segment. Pick a product or service and demonstrate how your selection of segmentation variables could be used in constructing an ad for this target group. Be creative in your choice of product or service and how you will advertise to the seniors segment.</p>

Vitamin Water (along with other Glacéau products such as Smart Water, Vitamin Energy, and Fruit Water) appears in an increasing number of outlets. Part of the reason for increased attention around Glacéau products is that they were purchased by the Coca-Cola Company in 2007. Coke’s marketing, advertising, and distribution muscle is being used to bring such products as Vitamin Water to the attention of the consuming public.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s04_p04">Another reason for increasing consumer attention is the maverick use of advertising by Vitamin Water. The labels, packaging, and advertising for Vitamin Water are highly entertaining.

Pick one company that you believe avoids discrimination in market targeting and one company that you believe does not. Compare and contrast the two companies with respect to their market target selection process and how the market targets are approached. Comment on any perceived ethical practices that you are aware of. Be sure to check any information on ethics provided by researching the Web sites of your two example companies. Lastly, list the ethical guidelines or best practices you believe organizations should follow when selecting market targets. Be prepared to discuss your thoughts and position.</p>
