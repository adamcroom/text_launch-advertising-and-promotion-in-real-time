    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_p02">Advertising is part and parcel of the daily world in which we all live—it’s the lifeblood of <em class="emphasis">popular culture</em>. It’s also an incredibly powerful mirror that reflects our values, aspirations, and fears (whether of social rejection, financial hardship, or just plain body odor). True, we may not always like what we see in this mirror. And it may not deliver a totally accurate reflection—like the looking glass in a funhouse, it may be distorted to magnify our noblest dreams as well as our basest desires. It’s a formidable weapon that people, businesses, and countries can harness for good or exploit for evil.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advertising Is Culture Is Advertising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s01_p01">Advertising’s cultural impact is hard to overlook, although many people do not seem to realize how much these pervasive messages influence their preferences for movie and musical heroes, the latest fashions in clothing, food, and decorating choices, and even the physical features that they find attractive or ugly in men and women.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s01_p02">For example, consider the product icons that companies use to create an identity for their products. Many imaginary creatures and personalities, from the Keebler Elves to the Burger “King,” have at one time or another been central figures in popular culture. Although these figures never really existed, many of us feel as if we “know” them. Check out the Icon Advertising Museum that will soon open in Kansas City to learn more. Even better, visit the museum’s Web site to see how many icons you recognize: <a class="link" href="http://advertisingiconmuseum.org">http://advertisingiconmuseum.org</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Advertising pervades all of our lives, and its presence only continues to grow as advertisers expand the formats they use to reach us and as we try to slake our growing appetites for information and entertainment. The average adult is exposed to about 3,500 pieces of advertising information every single day—up from about 560 per day thirty years ago.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s01_p05">Here’s a statistic to chew on: American Internet users ages twelve and older spend an average of <em class="emphasis">6.1 hours per day</em> interacting with video-based entertainment. About four of these hours are devoted to television viewing (live and recorded), while the rest goes to video games, Web and PC video, DVDs, and video on mobile devices. This sizeable chunk of time is projected to grow to eight hours per day by 2013. Where will the growth come from? One answer is online video; Nielsen tells us that in 2007 Americans watched 7.5 billion streams and 16.4 billion minutes in total of online video, and children ages two to eleven spend almost one-third of their online time watching videos. Expect advertisers to follow suit.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_011">eMarketer, “Video to Consume One-Third of Each Day” June 25, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.Emarketer.Com/Article.Aspx?Id=1006381&amp;Src=Article1_Newsltr">http://www.Emarketer.Com/Article.Aspx?Id=1006381&amp;Src=Article1_Newsltr</a> (accessed June 25, 2008); Brian Stelter, “Whichever Screen, People Are Watching,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 8, 2008 (accessed July 8, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s01_p06">So, is advertising a vapid cloud of superfluous fluff, or is it an efficient and entertaining process that enriches our lives? Obviously that depends on whom you ask. Let’s focus (first) on the reasons we should regard advertising as a glass half full. Then we’ll deal with the negative stuff.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Prosocial Advertising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p01">Can advertising save lives? Let’s investigate a recent project that answers a resounding “yes!” A public health professor named Val Curtis spent years in the developing world fighting what seems like a simple problem but turns out to be a frustrating battle: get people to wash their hands regularly with soap (sound like your mother?). It turns out that dirty hands spread diseases like diarrhea that kill a child somewhere in the world <em class="emphasis">about every fifteen seconds</em>, and about half those deaths could be prevented with the regular use of soap.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Dr. Curtis, an anthropologist then living in Burkina Faso, was almost ready to throw in the towel (pardon the pun). Then she decided to ask some consumer goods companies how <em class="emphasis">they</em> would convince people to wash their hands using the same techniques they rely upon to sell vitamins or deodorant that people tend to consume out of habit. As she observed, “There are fundamental public health problems, like hand washing with soap, that remain killers only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits. We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_012">Charles Duhigg, “Warning: Habits May Be Good for You,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Magazine</em>, July 13, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html? pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20 for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1</a> (accessed July 17, 2008).</span> These companies know very well how to create and reinforce such habits. For example, a century ago it was rare for anyone to brush her teeth twice a day, but efforts by Colgate and others changed all that.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Public health campaigns have had limited success in changing unhealthy habits. For example, evidence suggests that antidrug campaigns actually <em class="emphasis">increase</em> drug use, presumably because they remind people about the drugs to which they’ve become attached. It’s sort of like telling someone, “Whatever you do, don’t think of an elephant.” Did that work?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p04">Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Unilever accepted Dr. Curtis’s challenge and joined an initiative called the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. The group’s goal was to double the handwashing rate in Ghana, a West African nation where almost every home contains a soap bar but only 4 percent of adults regularly lather up after they use the toilet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p05">When participants started to look into the issue, they had the insight that the problem resembled one Procter &amp; Gamble first encountered when it introduced Febreze, a product it developed to remove odors from smelly clothes and furniture. Its ads initially focused on smelly situations, like pets, sweaty teenagers, and stinky minivan interiors. The launch flopped, and P&amp;G was ready to kill the product. Then its researchers found that consumers liked Febreze when they used it, but that many customers simply forgot that it was in the house. P&amp;G’s ads needed to give them the right <em class="emphasis">cues</em> to use the product. The company identified one: the act of cleaning a room. So, it created commercials showing women spraying Febreze on a perfectly made bed and on freshly laundered clothing instead of in smelly areas. The ads worked well—and the more people sprayed Febreze, the more automatic the behavior became. Now consumers buy $650 million of the stuff each year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p06">Back to handwashing in Ghana: studies showed that while about half of the people washed their hands before they ate or after they used the bathroom, only about 4 percent of Ghanaians included soap in this process. They also found that mothers often didn’t see symptoms like diarrhea as abnormal but instead viewed them as a normal aspect of childhood. But they also unearthed an interesting tidbit: Ghanaians <em class="emphasis">did</em> use soap when they felt that their hands were dirty, for example, after they cooked with grease. This habit was prompted by feelings of <em class="emphasis">disgust</em>, and they applied soap to eliminate this bad feeling.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p07">So the team came up with a big idea: create a habit to instill a feeling of disgust when people use the toilet, so that the emotional reaction would cue the use of soap. While many of us don’t hesitate to grimace at the thought of a less-than-sparkling bathroom, in many places in the developing world any toilet is a symbol of cleanliness, because flush toilets have replaced pit latrines. So the task was to create commercials to teach the audience to feel disgust after they went to the bathroom. The solution: the team shot ads of mothers and children walking out of bathrooms with a glowing purple pigment on their hands that contaminated everything they touched. These spots didn’t sell soap use, but rather disgust. Soap was almost an afterthought—one fifty-five-second television commercial only showed soapy hand washing for four seconds. Still, the link between disgust and its removal via soap was clear: the team’s follow-up research showed a 13 percent increase in the use of soap after the toilet, while the number of Ghanaians who reported washing their hands with soap before they eat rose by an impressive 41 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_013">Charles Duhigg, “Warning: Habits May Be Good for You,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Magazine</em>, July 13, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1</a> (accessed July 17, 2008).</span> This is no soap opera: advertising can save lives when it’s used creatively and when it thoughtfully applies what social scientists understand about human behavior.</p>

The group’s KentuckyFriedCruelty.com Web site featured the Pope’s photo next to a quote it attributed to him: “Animals, too, are God’s creatures.…Degrading [them] to a commodity seems to me in fact to contradict the relationship of mutuality that comes across in the Bible.” (Note: PETA didn’t ask for or receive the Catholic Church’s permission to use the photo or the quote.)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_015">Richard Gibson, “PETA Uses Religion in Boycott,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal Online Edition</em>, April 11, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117625218878365729.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117625218878365729.html</a> (accessed April 11, 2007).</span></p>

Corporate responsibility is now one of the primary attributes shoppers look for when they decide among competing brands. Consumer research strongly suggests that this awareness often starts with personal health concerns and then radiates outward to embrace the community and the environment.

Unfortunately, there’s also the very real potential that it will “poison the well” as it jumps onto the bandwagon a bit <em class="emphasis">too</em> energetically. It’s almost impossible to find an ad for virtually any kind of product, service, or company that doesn’t tout its environmental credentials, whether the focus of the ad is a detergent, a garment, a commercial airplane, or even an oil company. As a result, complaints about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">greenwashing</a><span class="glossdef">Advertising and marketing that misleads consumers about a product’s environmental benefits.</span></span>, or misleading consumers about a product’s environmental benefits, are skyrocketing. One egregious example is an ad for a gas-guzzling Japanese sport utility vehicle that bills the car as having been “conceived and developed in the homeland of the Kyoto accords,” the international emissions-reduction agreement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s04_p05">To prevent a greenwash backlash, it’s imperative for advertisers to act responsibly. There’s nothing wrong with trumpeting the environmental value of your product—<em class="emphasis">if</em> the claims are accurate and specific. Or you can suggest alternative methods to use your product that will minimize its negative impact—for example, Procter &amp; Gamble runs an ad campaign in the United Kingdom that urges consumers of its laundry detergents to wash their clothing at lower temperatures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_020">Suzanne Vranica, “Ad Houses Will Need to Be More Nimble: Clients Are Demanding More and Better Use of Consumer Data, Web,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, January 2, 2008, B3; Eric Pfanner, “Cooling Off on Dubious Eco-Friendly Claims,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 18, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/business/media/18adco.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Cooling%20Off%20on%20Dubious%20Eco-Friendly%20Claims&amp;st=cse">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/business/media/18adco.html? scp=1&amp;sq=Cooling%20Off%20on%20Dubious%20Eco-Friendly%20Claims&amp;st=cse</a> (accessed July 19, 2008).</span> The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) provides guidelines to evaluate green advertising claims; for example, it suggests that “if a label says ‘recycled,’ check how much of the product or package is recycled. The fact is that unless the product or package contains 100 percent recycled materials, the label must tell you how much is recycled.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_021">“Sorting Out ‘Green’ Advertising Claims,” Federal Trade Commission, April 1999, <a class="link" href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/general/gen02.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/general/gen02.shtm</a> (accessed July 19, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s04_p07">Advertising creates awareness and persuades people to change their opinions or behaviors. The same principles that advertisers use to sell cameras and cars apply to conservation or even contraception. Prosocial messages can significantly influence consumers’ daily lives in positive ways. Of late we see a huge emphasis on green messages; these can help to galvanize the world to take action in order to save the environment—if they don’t turn us off first by bombarding us with insincere claims.</p>
