In essence, the Web site did not have a brand positioning that was distinctive, or as distinctive as they wanted. This section will discuss the power of brands. We’ll learn why creating that distinct positioning of your product or service, and often your entire company, is so vital.</p>

Brands have been around for centuries. Early craftsmen put their marks on their wares to identify who made them, and artists have long signed their artwork. Since that time, however, branding has expanded well beyond just differentiation through marks and logos. Modern brands such as Apple, Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, and Wal-Mart now communicate meaning through attributes such as accountability, consistency, and even personality traits that their names have become associated with. These meanings translate to monetary value for the firm because their brand names acquire value—consumers willingly pay a premium to buy a product carrying a respected brand name as opposed to a similar product that carries an unknown brand name.</p>

Why is that so important? The answer is simple, yet profound: People don’t buy things because of what the things <em class="emphasis">do</em>. They buy things because of what they <em class="emphasis">mean</em>. There are many MP3 players out there that do just as good a job as an iPod, but they don’t convey the same image to consumers. So, one result of a solid branding strategy is to create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">barrier to entry</a><span class="glossdef">An obstacle that makes it more difficult for competitors to introduce their product to the marketplace.</span></span> so that competitors will find it difficult to persuade loyal consumers to abandon their favorite product for a newcomer.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Characteristics of a Solid Branding Strategy</h2>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Accountability</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01">Brands impose a sense of accountability on the maker of a product. If you buy an Acme shoe and it performs poorly, you’re unlikely to buy Acme shoes again. On the other hand, if you’ve had a good experience with Acme, you’re likely to buy its shoes again and perhaps its socks, shirts, or golf clubs as well. In this way, the brand is a shorthand way of signaling quality that simplifies decision making for customers. People who know and like a given brand are more likely to buy it again.</p>

        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Consistency</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s02_p01">Brands don’t have to be high end to command loyalty; they just need to communicate a consistent meaning to consumers. That might mean projecting an image of quality, but it can also mean being associated with consistently low costs (e.g., Wal-Mart), trendy fashion (e.g., Juicy Couture), or a particular lifestyle (e.g., Whole Foods Market). A brand thus serves to express key properties of the products the company produces.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s01_s03_p01">Just as people have personalities, so do brands. Personality refers to the traits that a person exhibits.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating a Corporate Image</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s02_p01">Corporations often engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">image advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Campaigns aimed at enhancing a corporation’s image and promoting the company’s public identity rather than selling a specific product.</span></span> to enhance the public perception of the firm in the eyes of its most important constituencies—typically the firm’s customers, employees, and local communities. Although these campaigns aim to promote the company’s public identity rather than sell a specific product, a corporation’s image is intimately tied to its brand personality. The image of the firm reflects on the image of its brands.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s02_p02">In 2007, for example, Dow Chemical Company allocated over $25 million for a corporate ad campaign it called “the human element.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn08_001">Rance Crain, “Dow’s Corporate Ads Have Great Chemistry, but Will Respect Follow?” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, August 6, 2007, 13.</span> The campaign was meant to appeal to local communities (who may or may not welcome Dow into their backyards), as well as legislators, journalists, environmentalists, employees, and shareholders. The idea behind the campaign is to show what the “human element” can do to solve some of the world’s problems, such as countering climate change and providing clean water, decent housing, health, safety, and an affordable and adequate food supply. Dow’s goal for the campaign is “to be acknowledged as the largest, most profitable, and most respected chemical company in the world.” Its CEO, Andrew Liveris, will consider the campaign a success “when a Dow employee in a bar anywhere in the world can tell the guy next to him where he works and get the response, ‘Oh, Dow. That’s good.’”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Holy Grail: Brand Equity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Brand equity</a><span class="glossdef">The value of a brand name over and above the value of a generic product in the same category.</span></span> is the extent to which a consumer holds strong, favorable associations with a brand and is willing to pay more for the branded version of a product.

As Roger Adams, senior vice president–CMO of Home Depot, said, “If you go to a grocery store or department store, there are brands on the shelf that have fundamentally the same function and one is 20 percent more than the other one. But people are paying that because there’s a belief in the brand or there’s an experience with the brand that builds trust, or they know if there’s a problem they can get service, that type of thing. And people do it every day.…That’s pretty much what brand marketing is about.”</p>
