    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_p01">It’s no secret that traditional advertising venues no longer provide the punch they used to. Advertising clutter makes it more difficult to get noticed in a crowded media environment, and even if people see or hear your ad, they are so busy multitasking that they may not react to it as you’d like. For this reason many advertisers look to alternative media either to replace or, more likely, to supplement their broadcast efforts. These options can be especially powerful for the client who needs short-term results (<em class="emphasis">buy something now</em>) rather than a longer-term brand building effort.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Point-of-Purchase</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p01">As the effectiveness of traditional media platforms continues to come under scrutiny, a lot of companies are allocating a greater proportion of their advertising dollars to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">point-of-purchase advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Also called <em class="emphasis">marketing-at-retail</em>. Can be an elaborate product display or demonstration, a coupon-dispensing machine, or even someone giving out free samples of a new cookie in the grocery aisle.</span></span> (POP, also called <em class="emphasis">marketing-at-retail</em>). U.S. companies spend more than $13 billion each year in this category. A POP can be an elaborate product display or demonstration, a coupon-dispensing machine, or even someone giving out free samples of a new cookie in the grocery aisle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p02">Coupons and other short-term sales promotions (e.g., “buy one, get one free”) are forms of POP that are extremely trackable—it’s fairly easy to monitor redemption rates to the <em class="emphasis">n</em>th degree so an advertiser knows exactly which offers resulted in purchases. The eventual impact on the bottom line? Not always so obvious—a rush of purchases in the short-term to take advantage of a big price reduction ironically might decrease the brand’s long-term value if these cuts cheapen its image! And you thought this was going to be easy.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p03">As we all know, the experiences we have in a retail environment exert a big impact on the likelihood we’ll purchase—though, again, these can be hard to quantify. However, POP industry experts claim that a well-designed in-store display can boost impulse purchases by as much as 10 percent. One study that compared short-term sales increases among a number of different media across three hundred campaigns reported that in-store fixtures yield an average of 160 percent, and in-store posters delivered a 136 percent return.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_018">“In-Store Marketing Gives Highest Return,” November 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.popai.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;section=June&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=897">http://www.popai.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;section=June&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=897</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p04">Due to the high stakes involved, several initiatives are under way to employ high-tech methods that more precisely measure just what happens in the store when consumers encounter advertising messages. The industry trade association POPAI (Point-of-Purchase Advertising Institute) is spearheading a major initiative with the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) to establish measurement standards for the industry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_019">“The Association of National Advertisers and POPAI Lead Global Marketing at-Retail Initiative (MARI),” <a class="link" href="http://www.popai.com">http://www.popai.com</a>, October 7, 2005 (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p05">In addition, an alliance of major marketers including Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, 3M, Kellogg, Miller Brewing, and Wal-Mart is using infrared sensors to measure the reach of in-store marketing efforts. Retailers have long counted the number of shoppers who enter and exit their stores, and they use product barcode data to track what shoppers buy. But big consumer-products companies also need to know how many people actually walk by their promotional displays so they can evaluate how effective these are. Although it’s possible to fool these sensors (they still can’t tell if someone is simply cutting through to reach the other end of the store), this sophisticated measurement system is a valuable first step that many advertisers eagerly await.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_020">Ellen Byron and Suzanne Vranica, “Scanners Check Out Who’s Browsing Marketers, Retailers Test Sensors to Weigh Reach of In-Store Promotions,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, September 27, 2006, B2.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p06">Finally, the marketing research company TNS is about to launch a new system to measure POP in grocery stores. The <em class="emphasis">TNS Insight Dashboard</em> will be a syndicated service that provides a report each quarter on the effectiveness of in-store marketing strategies. The Dashboard monitors where shoppers are in a grocery store at any given time, tracks the number of seconds they spend at any display and the amount of time they spend with other products, and then overlays these results with sales information so TNS can determine which displays actually lead to purchases. As a TNS executive observed, “A display’s stopping power is a good thing when it generates a lot of purchasing, but if people are spending many seconds there and not buying, something isn’t speaking to customers properly.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_021">Quoted in Sarah Mahoney, “TNS Unveils New In-Store Metrics For Grocers,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Daily</em>, July 14, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com">http://www.mediapost.com</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Out-of-Home Media</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s02_p01">Surprise—there is no standard metric for traditional billboard advertising. However, common sense suggests that these messages are more useful in some contexts than in others. Because passing motorists only see a billboard for a few seconds, this medium is more effective to convey a quick visual message than substantial information. Billboard messages need to be kept to five or six words at the most. In this case a picture truly is worth a thousand words. Again, it’s awfully hard to quantify the impact a vivid picture can make, though this could be substantial if it’s sufficiently interesting and differentiates the product (especially when people see it repeatedly).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s02_p02">Outdoor advertising is quickly moving to more sophisticated digital technology that people can see at a greater distance and that can present more detailed verbal information. In research conducted by OTX, a global consumer research and consulting firm, 63 percent of adults said that advertising on digital signage “catches their attention.” Respondents consider advertising in this media to be more unique and entertaining and less annoying than both traditional and online media. The study also reports that awareness of digital out-of-home media is high—62 percent of adults have seen digital signage in the past twelve months—and is at levels comparable to billboards, magazines, and newspapers. On average, people notice digital signage in six different kinds of locations during their week, giving advertisers the opportunity to intercept people with their brand message at various touchpoints during their weekly routines as they work, play, and socialize. It’s even more effective at reaching eighteen- to thirty-four-year-olds, who rate this medium higher than the general population.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_022">“Report: Digital Signage More Effective than Traditional Media,” October 24, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/article.php?id=18696&amp;prc=407&amp;page=190">http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/article.php?id=18696&amp;prc=407&amp;page=190</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Product Placement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s03_p01">In 2008 advertisers spent $3.6 billion to place their products in TV shows and movies. Until fairly recently, product placement was a casual operation where prop masters made informal arrangements to procure products they needed to dress a set. Today, it’s big business—but the effectiveness of these placements is anyone’s guess.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s03_p02">Nielsen, the company that compiles TV program viewership ratings, is working on a process with another company, IAG, to quantify when products appear in shows. IAG currently produces product placement ratings that are based on viewer recall; it asks 2.5 million people to respond to surveys online after they watch their favorite shows. These ask whether viewers remember the brand, think more positively about it, or want to purchase it, and whether the placement disrupted their viewing experience. Another firm called ITVX uses a system that measures up to sixty variables to determine a placement’s effectiveness, including whether a product appears in the foreground or background, whether a viewer is aware that a brand is on screen, and whether the show’s commercials are coordinated with the product placements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_024">Alana Semuels, “Research Firm Nielsen Tallying Product Placement Ads,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, July 21, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.latimes.com">http://www.latimes.com</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Video Advertising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s04_p01">Odds are you’ve watched a clip on YouTube recently. Advertisers want more access to viewers like you as online video advertising comes into its own. Some companies including CBS and Electronic Arts have reversed their positions about prosecuting users who post unauthorized clips of their content and have instead started to sell advertising on these spots. Interestingly, CBS is doing this even though its sister company Viacom is involved in a billion-dollar copyright lawsuit against Google, which owns YouTube.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_025">Brian Stelter, “Some Media Companies Choose to Profit from Pirated YouTube Clips,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, August 15, 2008 (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s04_p02">Reflecting the newness of this media platform, in 2006 the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) developed a set of guidelines to help the industry determine at what point a piece even qualifies as a video commercial. It defines a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">video ad</a><span class="glossdef">A commercial that may appear before, during, and after a variety of content including streaming video, animation, gaming, and music video content in a player environment.</span></span> as a commercial that may appear before, during, and after a variety of content including streaming video, animation, gaming, and music video content in a player environment. For now, the industry still uses CPM as its primary metric. The majority of video ads are repurposed fifteen- and thirty-second television commercials, but as yet there is little data about how these translate to the online environment, which length is most effective, and so on.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advergaming</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s05_p01">Advergames, as you learned in <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch10#solomon-ch10">Chapter 10 "Plan and Buy Media: SS+K Chooses the Right Media for the Client’s New Branding Message"</a>, are custom-made videogames specifically designed around a product or service, such as Sneak King by Burger King. Many advertisers are intrigued by the possibilities they see here, especially since the elements within an online game can be changed over time. Videogames also can show digital video ads before play, during breaks in a game, or following completion of the game. A client can introduce its products directly into the game in the form of beverages, mobile phones, cars, and so on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s05_p02">The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) is at work to define standard metrics for this new medium. The videogame platform shares some characteristics of online ads because when people play online, clients can track which specific elements in a game yield a response (e.g., when a player clicks on a sponsored link). The IAB has identified basic metrics that include:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s05_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per thousand (CPM)</em>—Advertising inventory is sold on the basis of “number of impressions delivered.” But just what constitutes an “impression” has yet to be agreed upon. For example, it may be defined as ten seconds of cumulative exposure to an ad format or element within a game session. In order for each one second to be counted, the scene the gamer sees must meet defined parameters for the angle of view to the ad in addition to the size of the ad unit on the screen. Other measurement methods count “interactive impressions” once there is an interaction between the gamer and the interactive ad unit.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per click (CPC)</em>—A media company or search provider is paid only when the user or visitor clicks on an ad.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per action (CPA)</em>—Performance ad networks often use this model where the revenue event is triggered only when the user or visitor takes the desired action with the advertiser (i.e., makes a purchase).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per view (CPV)</em>—This relatively new model triggers the revenue event only when the user or visitor opts in to view the ad, often by clicking on a prompt or “bug.”</li>
            <li>

<em class="emphasis">Basket-to-buy rate</em>: How many basket placements convert to purchases? This metric can tell the e-tailer which kinds of products shoppers are more likely to abandon in the shopping cart instead of buying them (believe it or not, this is a major problem for e-commerce businesses).

This method is easy to implement, but it can be misleading because it’s short-term oriented: one execution may result in a low cost per action, but customers may be “one-timers” who don’t return. Another execution might be more expensive, but customers may respond to it repeatedly over time, generating additional profits with no additional costs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_029">“True Campaign ROI Links to LTV (Lifetime Value),” <a class="link" href="http://www.jimnovo.com/ROILTV.htm">http://www.jimnovo.com/ROILTV.htm</a> (accessed August 15, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p01">Public relations campaigns traditionally measure impact in terms of the extent to which the client obtains media coverage. A basic metric is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">media impressions</a><span class="glossdef">An estimate of the number of people who see an ad in a magazine, a newspaper, or on a talk show or who hear about it in a radio interview.</span></span>; as you learned in earlier chapters, this is an estimate of the number of people who see the plug in a magazine or newspaper or on a talk show or who hear about it in a radio interview. A PR firm typically delivers a comprehensive list of media citations to the client, and it may rank these in terms of the prestige or circulation of the outlet or how prominent the mention was in this outlet. Again, this metric doesn’t really speak to any impact the citations have on actual purchases or attitude change.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_032">Deborah Holloway, “How to Select a Measurement System That’s Right for You,” <em class="emphasis">Public Relations Quarterly</em> (Fall 1992): 15–17.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p02">As WOM (word-of-mouth) assumes a greater role in many advertisers’ strategies—especially online buzz—the pressure is on for agencies to demonstrate that this approach does more than just make people talk about a brand. In fact, one prominent WOM agency called BzzAgent recently took a bold step to back up its claims that its buzz campaigns yield attractive ROI. With its “WOM Impact Guarantee” program the agency invites any brand marketer and its agency partners to take part in a challenge in which BzzAgent and the agency partner will run competing campaigns. If BzzAgent does not top the competing agency by 20 percent across four metrics—brand awareness, consumer opinion, purchase intent, and actual sales—the agency will refund the marketer the cost of its word-of-mouth campaign and measurement costs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_033">Michael Bush, “Better ROI or Your Money Back, Says Buzz Agency,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 14, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=129593">http://adage.com/article?article_id=129593</a> (accessed July 16, 2008).</span> That’s putting your money where your (word-of-) mouth is.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p03">The explosion of blogs, chat rooms, and Web sites that let consumers spread the word about products they love and hate opens an entire new realm of possibilities to develop metrics for WOM. Contrary to the assumptions of many students who brazenly post embarrassing photos of themselves on Facebook, the Web is forever—most content that goes online can be traced and analyzed long after it’s been put there. That photo of you from last weekend’s wild party might come back to haunt you someday!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p04">BuzzMetrics, a subsidiary of the Nielsen Company, offers marketers research services to help them understand how this consumer-generated content affects their brands. BuzzMetrics’ search engines identify online word-of-mouth commentary and conversations to closely examine phrases, opinions, keywords, sentences, and images people use when they talk about a client’s products. The company’s processing programs then analyze vocabulary, language patterns, and phrasing to determine whether the comments are positive or negative and whether the authors are men, women, young, or old to more accurately measure buzz. BuzzMetrics’ <em class="emphasis">BrandPulse</em> and <em class="emphasis">BrandPulse Insight</em> reports can tell advertisers how many people are talking about their products online, the issues they’re discussing, and how people react to specific ads or other promotional activities.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_034">Keith Schneider, “Brands for the Chattering Masses,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, December 17, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/business/yourmoney/17buzz.html?scp=4&amp;sq=buzzmetrics&amp;st=nyt">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/business/yourmoney/17buzz.html?scp=4&amp;sq=buzzmetrics&amp;st=nyt</a> (accessed April 14 2008); Nielsen Buzzmetrics, <a class="link" href="http://www.nielsenbuzzmetrics.com/products">http://www.nielsenbuzzmetrics.com/products</a> (accessed April 14, 2008).</span></p>

One of the goals of the marketing campaign was to unite their multiple views of what the brand stood for. It turned out that even before it launched, stakeholders felt the campaign was successful in that it gave msnbc.com a clear story. It gave them a common lens they could use to evaluate new design concepts and editorial content, while it gave msnbc.com the cachet stakeholders felt was long overdue. It successfully overcame the past ambiguity about whether the site was primarily an offshoot of NBC versus Microsoft and promised stakeholders a clearer future. The head of msnbc.com ad sales noted: “Clients have called us asking, ‘How do we do something similar?’ It’s opened up doors.”</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p28">Advertisers continue to search for new platforms as they compete for the attention of media-saturated consumers. Today virtually anything—from a cemetery to a rocket ship—can be used to get across a message. But these emerging venues don’t necessarily have a tradition (yet) of measuring direct impact. An exception is direct marketing; its lifeblood is about tying a message directly to a result. Whether via mail catalogs or online ads, direct marketers carefully track the effectiveness of each and every message they send. This sounds great, and it usually is—but remember, as we’ve already noted, short-term purchases may boost your bottom line this quarter but still come back to bite you in the long term if these messages don’t contribute to a more fundamental shaping of customers’ deep-seated feelings and beliefs about the product or service. And so, the search for the Holy Grail continues.</p>
