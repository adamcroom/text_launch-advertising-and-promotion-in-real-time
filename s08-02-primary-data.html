    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_p02">Sources of primary data include focus groups, customer interviews, and surveys the company conducts to understand the needs, behaviors, and reactions of consumers or other stakeholders such as business customers, vendors, or policymakers. Regardless of the data collection method, researchers conducting primary research need to decide whether to target a random sample of the entire population or to screen their participants according to a demographic, psychographic, or behavioral profile.</p>

        <h3 class="title">SS+K Spotlight</h3>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_p03">After John and Michelle reviewed the existing data, the next step was to speak to the people who know msnbc.com best—their employees. SS+K interviewed the key stakeholders within the organization including the president and representatives from editorial, design, ad sales, and technology. It was important for SS+K to understand how each of them perceived the brand, its challenges, and its opportunities.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_p04">After the interviews were conducted, in person by Joe Kessler or Melinda Moore, with Michelle, John, and Amit on the phone in New York taking notes, the AIU team (Michelle and John) started drawing some conclusions from those interviews.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_p05">They found that stakeholders agreed on interesting points and what they believed were the differentiators for msnbc.com versus their competitors. The research also showed that they each brought interesting and different ways to communicate this perceived difference. Some suggested approaching the communication through the technological advantages; others suggested touting original and high-quality journalism as the key message. Still other ideas involved better use of NBC personalities and the company’s multimedia experience.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_p06">One really encouraging finding from the interviews was the optimism that emerged about the future of the company and the future of the brand. The stakeholders noted that positive elements included the collaborative approaches within their vast organization, the increase in Web traffic, and the new online technologies that enable people to consume more and more information. Blogs, social networks, and other message-board technologies were going to continue to be important as the organization grew.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Surveys</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Surveys</a><span class="glossdef">The most common form of quantitative research, consisting of a questionnaire administered by mail or telephone, online, or through face-to-face “intercepts.”</span></span> are the most common form of quantitative research. They can be conducted by mail or telephone, online, or through “intercepts” such as when a market researcher stops shoppers in a shopping mall to answer a few survey questions. Surveys ask consumers about their activities, interests, and opinions. This often sheds light onto which publications or media the target audience reads or watches, which enables the advertising agency to fine-tune its message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Mail surveys increasingly are giving way to online questionnaires, because this format allows for instantaneous data collection and analysis (rather than waiting for printed surveys to be mailed and returned). Online questionnaires are also more flexible and cost much less. In both cases, however, while respondents are likely to be more honest because they can participate anonymously, we can’t be 100 percent sure who actually responds to the survey or whether the same person is responding multiple times.

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p03">Many online surveys basically reproduce their boring offline counterparts—scroll down the screen and answer a long series of questions by clicking on a number from 1 to 7. But some researchers take advantage of the Web’s unique capabilities as they create research instruments that are more vibrant and engaging for respondents. For example, an online survey could ask you to watch streaming video of different versions of an advertising execution and then prompt you to select the one you like best. Another might show you color pictures of facial expressions, landscapes, or celebrities and ask you to match them up with different brands. In one creative application, an online research company posted a gift finder on its Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.youniverse.com">http://www.youniverse.com</a>). To come up with gift ideas for a friend, the user chooses from sets of photos to answer questions about the person such as “Their favorite color is…” or “Their house looks like.…” The program then matches the answers with everything from gadgets to books. This kind of technology allows clients like MSN, Vodafone, and others to gauge consumers’ reaction to ad campaigns and identify clusters of consumers that respond most positively to different products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn05_002">Leila Abboud, “Picturing Web Shoppers: Start-Up Taps ‘Visual DNA’ to Gather Data,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, January 23, 2007, B9.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p04">Brand Tags, another ingenious application of Web research, shows visitors the logos of big companies and asks them to type in the first word or phrase that pops into their head when they see the logo. Within a few days after it went live, the site attracted more than thirty thousand visitors. Results of these snap reactions are reported as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tag cloud</a><span class="glossdef">A format for displaying survey results in which the size of a word corresponds to its frequency among responses; a frequently chosen response will appear very large on the screen, while a rarely chosen response will appear very small.</span></span>—a format in which the size of the word corresponds to its frequency among responses. Frequently submitted words are shown in giant type, while rarely submitted ones look tiny on the screen. This type of data is merely suggestive because we can’t be sure who responds, but it can be an eye opener to advertisers. For example, two popular responses for Wal-Mart are <em class="emphasis">cheap</em> and <em class="emphasis">evil</em>, one of Burger King’s largest tags is <em class="emphasis">fat</em>, while people label Toyota with words like <em class="emphasis">quality</em> and <em class="emphasis">reliable</em>—but also <em class="emphasis">boring</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn05_003">Tom Weber, “What Do People Think About Your Brand?

Unfortunately, in recent years telemarketers who masquerade as survey-takers poisoned the well for legitimate research companies; in some cases when they call (usually during dinner!) they lure unsuspecting respondents into answering questions until they reveal toward the end that they’re actually selling something.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p06">However, as mobile phones continue to evolve into the “third screen” for many of us (the first two are the TV and the computer monitor), it’s likely that enterprising researchers will discover new ways to collect people’s feedback via their phones. For example, the startup company Mimieo offers an application that enables a client to capture respondents’ emotional reactions to an ad or product on their iPhones.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn05_004"><a class="link" href="http://www.mimieo.com/corp/home.aspx">http://www.mimieo.com/corp/home.aspx</a> (accessed July 21, 2008); Laurie Sullivan, “Marketing Feedback Cards Go Digital via Cell Phones,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Daily</em>, February 27, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com">http://www.mediapost.com</a> (accessed February 27, 2008).</span></p>

They are also less likely to yield truthful results, for two reasons. First, being face to face with the interviewer, respondents may tend to give answers they think the interviewer wants to hear. Second, the interviewer’s biases (none of us is bias free, much as we may wish to think of ourselves that way) may skew the results.</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p10">After conducting the internal stakeholder interviews and reviewing the existing data, msnbc.com and SS+K set out to understand the consumer’s point of view and also to test a few hypotheses they’d drawn based on what they currently knew.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p11">These hypotheses revolved around three themes: (1) functional (What role does online news play in consumer’s lives?), (2) attitudinal (How do consumers feel about msnbc.com?), and (3) thematic (Are there certain categories of news to which consumers look?). It was important to understand what need they currently met in their consumers’ lives, and they designed their questions for the group to explore those areas.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s01_p12">They planned to explore these ideas and flesh them out in focus groups, which we’ll discuss next.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Focus Groups</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Often, an advertising campaign seeks to understand more subtle (or deeply held) attitudes than a survey can capture. This requires a more exploratory, interactive approach, such as one-on-one interviews between a consumer and a researcher or through a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus group</a><span class="glossdef">A small group of consumers, led by a trained facilitator, who discuss what they like and dislike about a product.</span></span> discussion (a discussion with a small group of consumers, led by a trained facilitator). The professional moderator is crucial to this process, preventing vocal members from overwhelming or dominating the group and effectively handling answers that don’t provide meaningful information or answers that a group member gives who is merely trying to impress other members (yes, this happens a lot!). Focus group discussions usually involve six to ten group members, and discussions are sometimes held in a room with a one-way mirror so that agency executives can watch or videotape the discussion—listening to real people talk about their product can be a real eye-opener for these folks!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s02_p02">For example, the city of Las Vegas decided to use focus groups to get a sense of how it should advertise itself in other countries as a tourist destination. The city worried that its “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas” campaign in the United States might not play well in countries like Mexico, which has a more Catholic and conservative population. To find out, the city held focus groups with travelers. The results of the focus groups showed that Mexicans were comfortable when the Vegas story lines fit with family customs and did not allude to casual sex. In the United Kingdom, in contrast, focus groups showed that the ad campaign needed more sex, not less, to catch the attention of U.K. audiences (who tend to see more provocative and explicit advertising). About a dozen focus groups of middle- and upper-income British men and women under age fifty-five revealed that the American tagline wasn’t compelling enough for irreverent British tastes. “In the U.S. we think our slogan and ads push the envelope, [but in Britain] for our message to have the same impact we discovered that we need to make it edgier,” said Rob O’Keefe, account director at R&amp;R Partners, the agency for the Las Vegas tourism group. “We need a bolder brand statement articulating that you can do things in Vegas you can’t do anywhere else.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn05_006">Quoted in Joan Voight, “How to Customize Your U.S. Branding Effort to Work around the World,” <em class="emphasis">Adweek Online</em>, September 3, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.nationaljewelernetwork.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003634197">http://www.nationaljewelernetwork.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp? vnu_content_id=1003634197</a> (accessed September 3, 2007).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch05_s02_s02_p03">Focus group disadvantages to watch out for are that people may be too tired to think after a hectic day, or that they may say what they think the researcher wants to hear, or that they may even feel pressured to make things up. Also, focus groups take people out of their normal lives and put them into a quiet room, which may lose the context of the real experience. For this reason, individual or group interviews in natural settings may be more desirable. Having a collaborative discussion with consumers in places where people actually use the products in question, such as a bar or laundromat rather than a research lab or an agency’s conference room, may provide more fruitful ideas. Some companies try to get consumers’ input across multiple stages, from focus groups to natural settings like supermarkets (if the product is a packaged food product) to journal entries that consumers record. This multifaceted approach imparts richness to the ideas, rather than just a slice that a phone interview or focus group can yield.</p>

The program was called “follow me home,” and the reason for watching consumers in their homes was to seek a natural, unscripted setting. Intuit continues to listen to customers through all sorts of channels, including blog posts and feedback buttons on the software itself. The 2006 version of Quicken, for example, included more than 121 customer-recommended improvements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn05_007"><a class="link" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/99/open_customer-intuit.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/99/open_customer-intuit.html</a> (accessed on September 9, 2007).</span></p>
