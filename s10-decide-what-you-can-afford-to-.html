    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_p01">Before the SS+K team could set off to develop their marketing recommendations, Catherine Captain had to set a budget for their efforts. It was important for Russell and Amit to understand the parameters of the work at hand; creative, media, and promotional recommendations would be vastly different for a $2 million effort versus a $20 million effort.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_p02">Once they were informed of the blanket budget to cover all SS+K related initiatives, it was up to them to work with Catherine to recommend the best way to make every dollar sing. But before the budget is split up, the client has to determine the total. As the VP of Marketing, Catherine had to request a certain amount of money from the board of msnbc.com—and justify why she wanted it. In the ad biz, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_p02">Budget decisions are affected by conditions both internal and external to the client. One key external influence is the overall economic condition of the country and how this affects the client’s industry. Even the most inspired advertising may not motivate consumers to open their wallets in troubled times like now. We see this situation now quite clearly, for example, in the automotive industry, as the stock market and credit crises have made money scarce, and consumers are pressed to pay higher prices for gasoline, home heating, groceries, and other necessities. It’s not surprising, then, that automotive advertising spending in the United States dropped to $1.99 billion in the first quarter of 2008. That sounds like a lot of money (and it is!)—but it’s down more than 14 percent compared with the same time a year before. As one industry executive observed, ad spending is “sinking as fast as new car sales.” When times are tough, nothing is sacred: Even Tiger Woods’ nine-year relationship as a fixture in General Motors’ advertising got the axe as the industry tries to slash its costs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_001">Quoted in “Auto Ad Spending Down, Except Digital,” <em class="emphasis">eMarketer</em>, July 23, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1006426&amp;src=article1_newsltr">http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1006426&amp;src=article1_newsltr</a> (accessed July 23, 2008); Rich Thomaselli, “GM Ending Tiger Woods Endorsement Deal,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, November 24, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=132810">http://adage.com/article?article_id=132810</a> (accessed November 28, 2008); <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=46288&amp;search_phrase=shona%20seifert">http://adage.com/article?article_id=46288&amp; search_phrase=shona%20seifert</a>.</span></p>

That percentage of sales is then applied to the expected sales in the coming year to arrive at the budget for that year. For example, if the company spent $20 million on advertising last year and had $100 million in sales, the percentage of sales would be 20 percent. If the company expects to achieve $120 million in sales the following year, then 20 percent of $120 million is $24 million, which would be the budget for advertising that year.</p>

For example, Procter &amp; Gamble’s ad-to-sales-ratio slipped from 10.7 percent in 2004 to 9.9 percent in 2006. Those declines came as P&amp;G faced growing margin pressure from rising commodity costs. Some analysts see strong ad spending as an investment in growth or a sign that a company is having no trouble meeting its earnings targets, so they want to see an ad-to-sales ratio that is consistent or increasing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_002">Jack Neff, “P&amp;G Rewrites its Definition of ‘Ad Spend,’” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, September 3, 2007, 3.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p01">Some companies use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">industry averages</a><span class="glossdef">A technique for evaluating ad-to-sales ratios based on the ratios seen in a group of companies in a given industry.</span></span> (published by trade associations) as a guide to set their promotional budget. Ad-to-sales ratios vary widely depending on the industry. For example, health services companies had one of the highest ad-to-sales ratios for 2006, at 18.7 percent. Other industries with high ad-to-sales ratios are transportation services (14.2 percent), motion pictures and videotape productions (13.7 percent), food (11.9 percent), newspapers (11.1 percent), and broadcast television stations (10.7 percent). In contrast, computer and office equipment had an ad-to-sales ratio of 1.2 percent, while computers and software wholesale had only a 0.2 percent ad-to-sales ratio.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_003">Kate Maddox, “Ad Spending Up in ’05, ’06,” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, August 8, 2005, 17.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p02">Sometimes a dramatic increase in ad spending by one competitor in an industry spurs others to follow suit. For example, in 2007 German insurance giant Allianz more than quadrupled its annual global advertising budget to 225 million euros after competitor Zurich Financial Services launched a large-scale global awareness campaign.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_004">“Allianz Plans €225m Global Branding Blitz,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Week</em>, May 3, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6503373/Allianz-plans-225m-global-branding.html">http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6503373/Allianz-plans-225m-global-branding.html</a> (accessed February 1, 2009).</span> Similarly, the auto insurance industry saw overall ad spending jump more than 32 percent in just two years when GEICO increased its ad spending 75 percent in 2004; this spurred competitors to increase their ad budgets as well. Progressive Insurance spent $265 million in 2006, up from $201 million in 2004, and State Farm likewise plans to increase spending, which topped $270 million in measured media in 2006.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_005">Mya Frazier, “Geico’s $500M Outlay Pays Off,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 9, 2007, 8.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p03">Spending on certain segments of the promotional budget, such as on coupons, is very much driven by competitor spending levels. Consumer packaged goods companies like P&amp;G and Unilever claim not to like couponing schemes as a promotional activity. Indeed, P&amp;G looked into eliminating coupons in 1997 due to declining newspaper circulation and usage. But companies are tied to using coupon promotions. If one company alone decides to forgo couponing, they face losing cost-conscious consumers to the competition. If companies try to work together to scale back on couponing, they might be accused of violating antitrust regulations. As a result, spending on the media side of couponing was up 26 percent in 2006, reaching $1.8 billion, even though consumer use of coupons was down 13 percent during the same time period.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_006">Jack Neff, “Package-Goods Players Just Can’t Quit Coupons,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, May 14, 2007, 8.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s01_s03_p01">The advantages of top-down approaches are their speed and straightforwardness. The disadvantage is that the methods look to the past as a guide, rather than to future goals. Just because a company spent $40 million on advertising the previous year doesn’t mean that figure is right for next year. Also, budgets tied to sales figures mean that a company’s promotional budget will decrease if sales decrease—but in fact increasing the promotional budget may be precisely what is needed in order to remedy declining sales.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p02">For example, champagne maker Moët &amp; Chandon set its objective “to grow the whole market” in the United States.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_007">Jeremy Mullman, “Moët, Rivals Pour More Ad Bucks into Bubbly: Champagne Makers Try to Create Year-Round Demand,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, September 3, 2007, 4.</span> That is, Moët will use advertising to increase consumption of champagne throughout the year, not just over the holidays. Moët based its objective on research that compared champagne consumption in the United States to that in other countries. “The average U.S consumer drinks half a glass of champagne a year, the average British consumer drinks half a bottle and the average French consumer drinks three bottles. There’s clearly room for growth,” said Stuart Foster, director of business development at Moët-Hennessy USA.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_008">Jeremy Mullman, “Moët, Rivals Pour More Ad Bucks into Bubbly: Champagne Makers Try to Create Year-Round Demand,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, September 3, 2007, 4.</span> Moët more than tripled its U.S. ad spending in 2006 to $9.5 million from $2.8 million. Reflecting the objective, the company ran its advertising in the summer rather than just around the holidays.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p03">Similarly, Danone Waters is increasing its ad spending in the United Kingdom in 2008 in an effort to increase bottled water consumption among British consumers. Danone Waters is increasing its spending by 15 percent, compared to Moët’s tripling of ad expenditures, which shows that there is no hard-and-fast rule about how much budget is needed to reach a given objective.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_009">Jeremy Mullman, “Moët, Rivals Pour More Ad Bucks into Bubbly: Champagne Makers Try to Create Year-Round Demand,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, September 3, 2007, 4; “Danone Waters Plans to Increase Spend by 15%,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing</em>, July 25, 2007, 4.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p04">Other objectives advertisers can set include acquiring new customers, retaining existing customers, or building the brand. The objective to acquire new customers often requires a bigger budget than the advertising the firm needs to retain existing customers.</p>

For example, Procter &amp; Gamble allocated $15 million to advertising Dawn Simple Pleasures, a new liquid detergent product that comes with a separate air freshener attached to the base of the bottle. It allocated less money ($10–12 million) for Dawn Direct Foam, a product it launched two years prior.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_010">Vanessa L.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s02_s02_p02">In contrast, companies such as baby food manufacturers need to invest in strong promotion on a continual basis, because they get a new set of customers every year. “We provide strong consumer promotion support to drive trial, particularly in our baby segments, where we have a new group of consumers entering the market each year,” said Randy Sloan, executive vice president and general manager at Del Pharmaceuticals, which is the number one advertiser in teething pain relief, children’s toothpaste, and adult oral pain products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_011">Quoted in “A Targeted Approach Creates a Powerhouse,” <em class="emphasis">Chain Drug Review</em>, June 4, 2007, 34.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s03_p01">In addition to deciding how much to spend, companies need to know when they will be spending the money.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s03_p02">For some companies, the timing is smooth. As we saw with the Moët champagne example, the company will spend its budget throughout the year. Many other businesses step up their advertising in the weeks leading up to the Christmas holiday season. Others, such as beach apparel makers or home improvement companies whose work is done in warm weather, may concentrate their spending during a particular time of year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s03_p03">Keep in mind that the budget needs to pay for more than just creating the ads and buying the media to run them. Consider a beachwear campaign for an apparel maker as an example. Although most of the campaign budget is spent in the second quarter on media buys to hit consumers with swimsuit ads as they gear up for summer, the ad agency has to allocate some of the money to laying the groundwork for this campaign. It will need to spend some money in the earlier part of the year to pay for market research, ad development, and testing. After the ads run, the last of the budget might go to assess the campaign’s effectiveness.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s03_p04">Other factors that contribute to budgeting:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>Media costs: For retailers, the holiday season is a popular time, so like all things supply and demand, media costs tend to go up during that time.</li>
            <li>Production costs: An incredible number of components contribute to making an ad, whether it’s TV, Web banner, or print, and the cost can vary widely, which is important to consider when you build a bottom-up budget.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s01_s03_p07">Clients use a variety of methods to determine their advertising budgets. One basic distinction is between top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down approaches are easier; they basically use last year’s expenditures as a starting point. However, they also are more simplistic and may be self-defeating because they wind up allocating more money to promote products that are doing well at the expense of products that are doing poorly—when just the opposite adjustment may make more sense. Bottom-up approaches start by specifying the particular objectives a firm has for a brand and then estimating how much it will cost to meet those objectives. Budget-setting is more complicated than just tallying up what it costs to make and place advertising; the client also has to consider the resources an agency will need to conduct research, develop an advertising strategy, and measure how well the strategy worked so it can tweak the approach in the future if necessary.</p>

However, since a major objective for the campaign was to increase awareness and impressions, the agency deliberately used tactics that resulted in large SOV on a particular day. For example, when they placed their ads on Web sites they would try to engineer a “homepage takeover” or a “roadblock,” meaning that all the available ad units on the homepage are dedicated to one advertiser.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s02_s01_p04">In situations where big clients compete on a fairly even playing field (unlike SS+K’s “David and Goliath” situation with <a class="link" href="http://www.msnbc.com">msnbc.com</a>), share of voice is an important indicator of competitiveness. It reflects the extent to which your customers are being influenced by your ads versus those of rivals who also try to get their attention with similar messages. Long-term analysis shows that brands that increase their share of voice with powerful advertising stand a better chance of increasing their market share.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s02_s01_p05">High SOV helps provide top-of-mind awareness and provides a company with a competitive advantage because this awareness allows it to dictate what criteria consumers use to evaluate products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_013">“Pepsi introduces freshness dating,” <em class="emphasis">Chain Drug Review</em> (April, 1994), <a class="link" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3007/is_199404/ai_n7964159">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3007/is_199404/ai_n7964159</a>, (accessed July 23, 2008).</span> For example, in the last century (1994, to be exact) the heavy advertiser Pepsi introduced “freshness dating” on its products and convinced many consumers that it’s important to buy cans of soda that are less than a year old.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_014">“Research Ensures Rewards,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Week</em> (July 5, 2007), p33.</span> This campaign was pretty successful—even though in reality a very small percentage of soft drink inventory in a grocery store would linger on the shelves for that long.

If the competition has cut back on spending (such as during an economic downturn like we’re now experiencing), then you might maintain your current level of ad spending and still garner a high SOV. If your company has many competitors or bigger competitors, you may find it impossible to outspend them to achieve a high SOV.</p>

Sometimes they prefer to concentrate their limited resources to get a bigger bang for the buck during a limited time period and forgo the opportunity to send out their messages at other times.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s02_p01">ROI is the language of business. Although many marketing people traditionally evaluate a campaign’s success in terms of intangibles like brand awareness, top management insists on more tangible results: ka-ching! Advertisers face increasing pressure to translate the results of what they do into ROI terms. If they succeed, they can assure the bean counters that if they’re given a certain amount of budget, they will earn the company <em class="emphasis">x</em> percent more. But it’s not so easy to quantify the effects of ad messages, and it never has been. One well-known quote (so well known it’s practically a cliché) that has at times been attributed to Henry Ford, retailing executive John Wanamaker, and others sums up this dilemma: “I know that half of my advertising works—I just don’t know which half.”</p>

These are vitally important questions—especially because the networks set their rates for advertising based upon how many people see their shows. To date there still is no foolproof way to deliver these <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">metrics</a><span class="glossdef">Quantifiable measures that gauge the direct impact of a marketing communication.</span></span>, and it’s the source of a lot of controversy in the advertising industry.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s02_p03">The dominant measurement system is the Nielsen Television Ratings that the networks have relied upon since the earliest days of television. The Nielsen Company collects these measures by recruiting a panel of consumers who keep a diary of what they watch and by so-called set meters that it connects to members’ TV sets to transmit data about which channels get selected. These methods suffer from obvious problems—for example, our memories about what we watch often are distorted and biased, and just because a set is tuned to a channel doesn’t mean anyone is actually watching. Nielsen is working hard to update its technology with People Meters that individual members of the household use to record their viewing behaviors. GfK AG’s Mediamark Research Inc. also is developing a pager-size media-measurement device. And, to keep pace with consumers’ changing habits, Nielsen has started to measure out-of-home viewing (in bars, dorms, and other locations) as well as the usage of digital video recordings like TiVo. Nielsen is also working on a new measurement system it calls Anytime Anywhere Media Measurement. This system will track a group of sample viewers—but it will monitor their usage of several different media including the Internet, mobile devices like iPods, and traditional television.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_016">Emily Steel, “Who’s Watching Those Webisodes?

One new research firm called TRA (True ROI Accountability for Media) is trying another strategy: it merges data from people’s cable set-top boxes with consumer-purchase databases, such as the information stores gather from frequent-shopper cards. For instance, a company could see whether households that watched an ad for its toothpaste later bought that brand of toothpaste. In a test of its system, TRA is using data from cable boxes to measure second-by-second viewership of TV programs and commercials in three hundred thousand households in Southern California, and it aims to sign up more than one million U.S. households across the country in the near future.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_017">Stephanie Kang, “Couch to Supermarket: Connecting Dots,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 11, 2008, B7.</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s01_p03">As difficult as the ROI of traditional advertising vehicles is to measure, word of mouth is even harder to measure. As online content chatter on blogs and Web sites continues to mushroom, advertisers need to measure just what consumers are saying about their products and how active they are in spreading the word about viral marketing campaigns or other online promotions. Buzz Metrics, a subsidiary of the Nielsen Company, offers marketers research services to help advertisers understand how CGM (consumer-generated media) affects their brands. Nielsen’s Buzz Metrics search engines identify online word-of-mouth commentary and conversations to closely examine phrases, opinions, keywords, sentences, and images people use when they talk about a client’s products. The company’s processing programs then analyze vocabulary, language patterns, and phrasing to determine whether the comments are positive or negative and whether the authors are men, women, young, or old to more accurately measure buzz. BuzzMetrics’ <em class="emphasis">BrandPulse</em> and <em class="emphasis">BrandPulse Insight</em> reports tell advertisers who is talking about their products online and what they say about the ads they’re seeing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_023">Keith Schneider, “Brands for the Chattering Masses,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, December 17, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/business/yourmoney/17buzz.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/business/yourmoney/17buzz.html</a> (accessed December 17, 2006); Nielsen Buzzmetrics, <a class="link" href="http://www.nielsenbuzzmetrics.com/products">http://www.nielsenbuzzmetrics.com/products</a> (accessed April 14, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s02_p01">Ideally, payback should be about profit, but many companies confuse added profit with added revenue. To avoid these mistakes, clothing manufacturer VF Corp (whose brands include Lee, Wrangler, Nautica, and The North Face, among others) spent two years and millions of dollars studying consumer responses to its marketing efforts while seeking to determine which of its brands have gotten the best ROI from advertising. “We are convinced we can be more effective by having a better understanding of marketing return on investment and will get paid back on our investment several times over,” said Eric Wiseman, president/COO at VF.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s02_p02">In 2006, VF spent about $325 million on advertising across all its brands. The Nautica brand is already reaping the benefits of VF’s ROI research. The company increased Nautica’s marketing budget the next year. “Our budget is up and we are moving the mix around,” said Chris Fuentes, vice president of marketing at Nautica. “We’ve looked at each element of our marketing—magazines, newspaper, outdoor, sponsorship, public relations—[and] we can isolate what is working. We’re understanding now what is driving consumption and building brand equity.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s02_p03">The research helped the company decide that Nautica’s advertising budget should be increased because the advertising was providing a good return on investment. What’s more, the research helped Nautica pinpoint which of its campaigns were most effective in bringing that return. Nautica is using that information to decide how to allocate its advertising budget. Nautica uses an integrated marketing program of print, outdoor, and Internet advertising. The research showed that newspaper ads generated underachieving results, so Nautica will spend less on them, but it will boost its Internet presence to target young men for its new N series jeans. Nautica spent $20 million on ads in 2006.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_024">Quoted in Sandra O’Loughlin, “VF Designs Dynamic Future for Lee, Wrangler, Nautica: ROI Study Spurs Aggressive Marketing Plans at $7B Company,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em> April 9, 2007, 16.</span></p>

Nautica relies on its ROI research to drive budget allocation among different campaigns, allocating more to those that have provided the best return in the past. For example, Nautica’s sponsorship of the AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Tour produced good results. So, in 2007, Nautica increased its presence there, adding on-court billboards and a scoreboard bug on the TV screen, and having announcers and pro Misty May outfitted in Nautica apparel.</p>

Like traditional advertising, it’s hard to determine how effective these messages are—though we know that in some categories (e.g., grocery) many shoppers don’t make their final decisions until they’re wheeling their carts through the aisles (never go food shopping when you’re hungry!).</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p03">A major new initiative called P.R.I.S.M. (Pioneering Research for an In-Store Metric) is attempting to quantify the impact of these messages. Participating companies include Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, ConAgra, General Mills, Kroger, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, 3M, Walt Disney, Kellogg, Miller Brewing, and even Nintendo. Ad agencies OMD and Starcom MediaVest Group, as well as multiple retailers, are also involved. The measurement model predicts consumer reach by category or area of the store, by retail format, and by day of the week, delivering unprecedented insight into the store as a marketing channel.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p04">The consortium’s research team began working on the theory that, by predicting in-store traffic, then determining what marketing communications are in the store, it could calculate the “opportunities to see” a specific communication. By using existing statistical models that factor out duplicate impressions (accounting for multiple “visits” to the area by the same people) a measurement for consumer reach could be calculated for specific locations in the store. Initial tests have been promising. The CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble recently predicted, “P.R.I.S.M. will transform how we think about in-store consumer communications and behavior.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_025">Quoted in David Goetzl, “P&amp;G CEO Endorses In-Store Marketing Measurement,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Daily</em>, February 25, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=77117">http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=77117</a> (accessed February 25, 2008); “The P.R.I.S.M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s04_p01">Most advertising ROI metrics tend to focus on short-term profits from the immediate response to an ad. This emphasis is appropriate in some contexts; for example, that’s one of the big advantages of direct marketing, because the firm can immediately trace the impact of a mailing or e-mail blast and decide right away if it boosted orders.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s04_p02">On the other hand, brand-building campaigns produce a low ROI in terms of short-term profits, but they are crucial for the long term. In these cases managers may need to adopt a broader field of vision and be patient, even if they are bleeding red right now. For example, one company discovered that every dollar the company spent on TV advertising yielded only eighty cents back in short-term sales. Executives were thinking of chopping the TV budget, but the general manager said, “Just because print and promotion activities have the highest ROI, doesn’t mean they should get the majority of the money. Print only accounts for a small fraction of total sales, and while TV has a lower ROI, it’s responsible for a huge amount of ongoing sales.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_026">Quoted in Randy Stone, “When Good Returns Mean Anything But,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, April 9, 2007, 20.</span> This reasoning shows that the bigger picture must be taken into account when managers make budget decisions. Making this case can be a daunting task for advertising agencies, especially when their clients are under pressure to show profitable returns to their shareholders.</p>

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s03_s03_s04_p03">At the end of the day, it’s all about ROI. Ad agencies and other promotional companies are coming under increasing pressure to show specifically how their activities deliver value to the client—by quantifying how much financial return the client receives in exchange for the money it spends to advertise. Showing ROI is difficult when many campaigns are more about building long-term awareness and loyalty than prompting immediate purchases (sales promotions, online advertising, and direct marketing are better able to link specific messages to specific results). However, there is a silver lining: this greater discipline forces advertising agencies to be more accountable—and in the process perhaps change the mindset of managers who tend to view advertising as a cost they need to minimize rather than as an investment in the brand’s performance.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.4</span> Managing a Budget</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s04_p01">Now that you understand the importance and implications of marketing investments, it’s important to set up your budget specific to the needs of the campaign and the client. From <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch07_s01#solomon-ch07_s01_s03_f01">Figure 7.3 "msnbc.com Budget Allocation"</a> we know that msnbc.com had to monitor its spending by month and by category (agency fee, production, media, promotions, etc.). This budget was set up to reflect the contract between SS+K and msnbc.com that spelled out the categories and the amounts of the client’s money that the agency was entitled to spend.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s04_p02">The open collaboration and understanding of financials is key to the success of any business partnership. Both sides are responsible for staying in budget, and the agency is specifically responsible for justifying anything it spends for any purpose to a client. Former Ogilvy and Mather executives Shona Seifert and Thomas Early learned this lesson the hard way. In 2005, both were convicted and sentenced to prison for their roles in overbilling one of the agency’s clients, the Office of National Drug Policy. Seifert also was ordered to write a code of ethics for the entire ad industry as part of her sentence.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn07_027">Matthew Creamer, “Shona Seifert Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 14, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/abstract.php?article_id=46288">http://adage.com/abstract.php?article_id=46288</a> (accessed February 1, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch07_s04_p03">There are a few key pieces to managing the budget: <em class="emphasis">bids, estimates, invoices,</em> and <em class="emphasis">actuals</em>.

Sometimes jobs are billed at 100 percent of an invoice. Another common practice is to bill 50 percent of an invoice up front and 50 percent upon completion.

Such questions as “Where are you?” “What are you doing?” and “Where can we meet?” seem to be the most popular.

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s05_p08">According to information in the chapter, “return on investment (ROI) makes advertising more accountable.” Advertisers spend vast sums to further their communication objectives. Studies have indicated that advertising campaigns that set hard objectives (e.g., to improve profits) are more effective than campaigns that focus on intermediate or short-term goals (e.g., brand awareness or increased daily sales of product). Strangely, however, only about 20 percent of companies use return on investment or contribution to profit as important indicators of communication success. Why don’t more companies consider bottom line profits when evaluating success? The simple answer is that it is easier to measure an intermediate metric than an ROI metric.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch07_s05_p09">Take a position that considers the ethics of accountability. Position One: Communication and delivery of emotional message objectives should not be tied directly to profits because of the difficulty of tracing profits back to specific emotional messages. Position Two: In an era of accountability, all messages should be more rational and have profit enhancement as their fundamental purpose.</p>
