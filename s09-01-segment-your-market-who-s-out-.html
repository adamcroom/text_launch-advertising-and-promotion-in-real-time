It’s crucial to slice up the pie so you can focus your resources on customers whose needs you have the best chance of satisfying. These are the benefits of a segmentation approach.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_p03">Segmenting the population gives you a concrete vision of your potential customer. For example, targeting upper-income unmarried men with a college education gives you a more specific vision of the intended audience than does simply advertising to “people.”</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_p04">Segmenting the population provides focus and specificity on those people most likely to buy your product. It’s better to find the five million people who are 80 percent likely to buy than it is to find the eighty million people who have a 5 percent chance of buying.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_p05">Segmenting the population lets you estimate the number of people in a given category (such as “Affluent Retirees”), which gives you an idea of your potential market size.

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s01_p03">While demographics can be an effective way to begin to understand your potential consumers, msnbc.com and SS+K knew that they would need to dig deeper to identify the specific audience for their branding campaign. While some product categories can move forward with demographic information only, services such as news, entertainment, and sports media need more information to fine-tune their targets. For example, the Bravo network, which has successfully created numerous high-style reality shows that revolve around upscale pursuits like gourmet cooking, fashion modeling, or home design, recently developed for advertisers a one-off (that is, one-time publication) magazine it called <em class="emphasis">Bravo Affluencer</em>. Each of the two people on the cover represented a distinct psychographic segment that is key to Bravo’s targeting strategy: an attractive man and woman, both in their late twenties, shopping bags and PDAs in hand, passports visible in pockets, dressed casually but stylishly. These two models are reminiscent of the popular stars of the sitcom <em class="emphasis">Will and Grace</em>—and that’s no accident. Bravo executives actually use the phrase “Will and Grace” to describe two of their key viewer segments: urban gay men and single female professionals. Many of the network’s most popular shows such as <em class="emphasis">Project Runway</em> and <em class="emphasis">Top Chef</em> attract these viewers in large numbers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_002">Susan Dominus, “The Affluencer,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Magazine</em>, October 30, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02zalaznick-t.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rsscc">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02zalaznick-t.html? partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rsscc</a> (accessed November 5, 2008).</span> As we learned in <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch05#solomon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Know Your Audience: SS+K Learns All About msnbc.com, Inside and Out"</a>, SS+K and msnbc.com had done significant segmenting and research to identify their target audience, the <em class="emphasis">News Explorer</em>.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Advertising channels</em>. Some advertising strategies, such as newspapers and direct mail, are strongly tied to geography.

People who live in zip codes located in the suburbs see ads for SUVs, while those in the cities see commercials for cars—during the same programs. As you’ll learn in the media planning chapter, msnbc.com made very strategic geographic media and messaging decisions in order to maximize the value of their buy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_004">“For car marketers, local cable ads are spot-on,” <em class="emphasis">Automotive News</em>, May 28, 2007, 26F.</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s03_p01">While demographics are useful, advertisers often need to slice and dice even further. Traditional demographic segments (such as gender, age, and income) provide only a rough estimate of the attitudes and desires of different groups, so marketers often give consumer groups labels that capture something about their lifestyles and motivations as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s03_p02">Imagine an advertiser that defines a segment as <em class="emphasis">recent moms</em>. This label implies that all women who have recently given birth are fairly similar and that they all will respond the same way to an advertising message—how accurate is that assumption? Bloomingdale’s Quotation, a store-within-a-store, instead calls its target market “yummy mummies.” These are women age thirty-five to forty-five who have gained weight after their babies but don’t want to look matronly. They are affluent, suburban, and casual yet fashionable. Bloomie’s research department provided further insight into the target customer: she thinks classic sportswear like Jones New York is too formal but contemporary sportswear like Juicy Couture is too young.

For example, Svedka Vodka targets urban party people who are out drinking until three o’clock in the morning three nights a week. This target market is irreverent, and Svedka’s ads speak their language.

When GlobalCerts began its direct mail campaign, it collected information on its key prospects, including their needs, buying cycle, and decision makers’ contact information. Knowing the buying cycle of an organization is important because decision makers need different kinds of information, depending on where they are in the buying cycle. Early on, decision makers are looking for more general information about solutions that meet their business needs. In later stages, they want very product-specific performance information.

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_p03">Defining the audience is a job for both the left brain and the right brain. We use this expression because in general the left side of our brains is more rational and fact-oriented while the right side is more emotional and artistic. Some people tend to be more logical when they approach problems while others are more creative and emotional. For fans of the original <em class="emphasis">Star Trek</em> TV series, just think of Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy and you’ll get the difference immediately.</p>

Even the most comprehensive demographic profile seldom communicates a sufficiently nuanced understanding of any group of consumers. At SS+K, the account planners and researchers that make up the AIU are charged with acquiring information beyond current user demographics that will allow the account, media, and creative team to visualize and understand the consumer. An insightful and comprehensive target profile should enable the writers and art directors to imagine the target consumer so well, in fact, that the creatives can develop an empathic understanding of that consumer’s relevant needs and wants. The more complete the creatives’ understanding of the audience, the more likely the team will be able to craft a message that speaks in an authentic, compelling voice to the target consumer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_p05">If an agency relies on simple demographics to define its target market, the risks of oversimplification and naïve projections are considerable. The job of an account planner like SS+K’s Michelle Rowley is to dig deeper; to see, understand, and report significant differences among potential target markets on the basis of characteristics that aren’t immediately apparent to just anyone with access to a marketing database.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_p06">The profile provided Michelle with a basic understanding of the msnbc.com user. In addition to some telling demographics, Michelle had a good sense of how users describe their technological acumen and online news-gathering behavior and preferences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_p07">After analyzing a veritable mountain of proprietary research already collected by the client, Michelle and her colleagues identified a trio of expectations consumers brought to their online news and information experiences. First, the online news audience assumed “the cost of entry” for credible sources was an ability to provide breaking news in a <em class="emphasis">timely</em> fashion; research indicated that consumers considered this a generic attribute and not a point of differentiation for any news provider. The second and third expectations were also considered essential <em class="emphasis">parity characteristics</em> (i.e., elements that any competitor would need): a <em class="emphasis">well-organized site</em> that provides ease of access and a <em class="emphasis">multi-faceted</em> presentation of text, photos, and video. Users said the most important attribute for news and online information providers was to provide <em class="emphasis">trusted</em> coverage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_p08">Beyond that, there were still some significant gaps in the research that Michelle and company had to fill before they were prepared to commit fully to a target audience and position the brand in the marketplace. SS+K wanted to better understand the factors involved in making a choice for news and information:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_l02">
            <li>What role does news and information play in the lives of online consumers?</li>
            <li>What were the emotional drivers in choosing a source?</li>
            <li>Who was likely to influence others’ choice of a news site, and how was this influence exercised?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_p09">Once these more global issues were better understood, SS+K could more effectively address how to position msnbc.com relative to its competition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s01_s05_p10">Understanding consumers’ behaviors, as well as their motivations and gratifications for using particular sites, was a key focus of the next research phase. The ultimate goal was to find a voice, a tone, a way of presenting the brand that was relevant and clearly differentiated in the minds of the consumers as unique to msnbc.com. Michelle and her colleagues organized focus groups and interviews for further exploration of the opposing goals and perspectives suggested by the initial research. Among these were the following:</p>
