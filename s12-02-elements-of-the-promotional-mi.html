        <h2 class="title editable block">Sales Promotions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_p01">A sales promotion is activity intended to produce some short-term change in behavior. This can range from a cents-off coupon that motivates a customer to buy a box of cereal today to a sales contest that inspires an employee to sign up as many customers as he can by the end of the month.</p>

The key element of sales promotions is its limited-time nature. Consumer sales promotion tools include the following:</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Price or Value Discount Promotion Tools</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">Price or value discount promotion tools include <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coupons</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that offers consumers cents off the price and has an expiration date of a few months out, encouraging immediate purchase.</span></span> for packaged-goods products like deodorant. These offer cents off the price and have an expiration date of a few months out, encouraging immediate purchase. Similarly, pizza delivery companies located near colleges typically have special deals at the start of the semester to entice new customers.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s01_s01_p02">In addition to coupons companies place in newspapers, send by mail (or by mobile phone), or offer on a Web site, a marketer may offer a temporary price reduction at the store or offer a rebate. Unlike a coupon, which gives the discount immediately upon purchase, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rebate</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that refunds part of the purchase price after the consumer fills out and returns a form along with a sales receipt.</span></span> refunds part of the purchase price to the consumer after the consumer fills out and returns a form along with a sales receipt to the company.</p>

Some companies offer bonus packs twice a year as a way to reward customers with special offers. Other companies time their bonus packs to economic cycles. “Whenever there is a downturn in the economy, we do very well with bonus packs and opening price shampoos like Suave, VO5 and Jheri Rhedding,” said Larry Vick, divisional merchandise manager for ShopKo. During difficult economic times, people are careful with their money and like to buy products that offer more of the good for the same amount of money.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_004">Liz Parks, “Value-Priced Bonus Packs Revive Limp Hair Care Segment.” <em class="emphasis">DSN Retailing Today</em>, April 22, 2002, 19.</span> Hint: With all of the economic woes surrounding us, the coupon business is a pretty nice place to be right now.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s01_s02_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">premium</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that gives consumers a free item with purchase of another item.</span></span> is a free item you receive if you purchase another item. Sexy Hair Concepts, for example, offered free styling gel with purchase of their shampoo or conditioner during the “Girls Night Out” days at Beauty Brands retail stores. In some cases, the premium may directly encourage future product sales, such as the Campbell’s Soup Cookbook containing new recipes that just happen to call for additional soup flavors.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s01_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Contests</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that offers consumers the opportunity to win a prize; winning is based on skill and may involve purchasing or using the product (e.g., a recipe contest using a certain food item).</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sweepstakes</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that offers consumers the opportunity to win a prize; winning is based on luck and by law cannot be tied to purchase.</span></span> offer the opportunity to win an exciting prize like a vacation to Hawaii or a $1,000 shopping spree. The difference between the two is that a contest is a test of skill, whereas a sweepstakes is simply based on luck. For example, a contest may ask consumers to bake a cake using the brand as an ingredient, whereas a sweepstakes simply requires filling out the entry form.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s01_s02_p03">By law, sweepstakes cannot be tied to a purchase, which means that any consumer can be eligible to win the prize if they fill out the entry form. Therefore, it’s best to use sweepstakes to build awareness of your brand, not to drive immediate sales. The sweepstakes should be cleverly tied to your brand. For example, if your product is canned pineapple, a sweepstakes with the grand prize of a trip to Hawaii makes sense. If your product is motor oil, a sweepstakes in which the grand prize is a chance to be on a NASCAR pit crew team is more relevant and effective than winning a lunch date with Hannah Montana (Danica Patrick is another story). Sweepstakes also offer an opportunity to generate publicity (discussed below) during a time when you are not introducing new products.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sampling</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that offers consumers a product for free; samples are often trial size but may be full size.</span></span> is a popular (though expensive) promotional tool. Food and beverage companies often provide free samples to consumers to give them a chance to try a new product for free. More than one college student has feasted for free by timing strategic visits to stores like Sam’s Club that provide tastes of new food items. Sometimes the packets will be a smaller trial size, such as two packets of Celestial Seasonings tea rather than a box; other times the sample will be full size, like a cup of Silk yogurt. In the example we mentioned previously, Unilever handed out free samples of its new detergent. Sampling intends to increase future sales volume by acquiring new customers for the product.</p>

Frequent flyer programs such as the United Airlines Mileage Plus program offer free miles to their customers with each flight they purchase. The more miles they fly per year, the bigger the bonus mileage. For example, customers who fly fifty thousand miles or more per year get double bonus miles (a hundred thousand miles or the equivalent of four free airline tickets in the United States) for the miles they’ve purchased. These loyalty programs offer additional perks, such as shorter lines, to their loyal customers. Restaurants or coffee shops often have punch cards that reward customers with a free coffee or sandwich after the purchase of nine coffees or sandwiches.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p01">As consumers we probably don’t see many of the more aggressive promotions that companies sponsor. Trade promotions are for a company’s employees or for channel partners such as retailers or wholesale distributors who help get the product in the hands of the ultimate customer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p02">Trade promotions fall into two main categories: discount promotions and industry visibility. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Discount promotions</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that encourages a trade partner to stock an item by offering a reduced cost or helping to defray the partner’s advertising expenses.</span></span> offer the trade partner a reduced cost on the product or help to defray the partner’s advertising expenses.

Distributors and retailers learn more about a company’s products and can ask questions or experience the product directly. The manufacturer, in turn, collects business cards and sales leads on potential partners. For example, to draw customers into its booth at fluid industry shows, ITT (a company that manufactures fluid technology systems) built a water fountain branded with ITT and placed a sixty-by-eighteen-foot, three-dimensional banner at the entrance to the convention hall.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_005">Kate Maddox, “The Future Looks Bright, with Marketing Expanding and Online Exploding,” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, December 11, 2006, 28.</span></p>

                    <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s02_p02">The trade show industry generates billions of dollars a year and affects the economies of many other sectors such as travel and hospitality. Some major trade shows dwarf the size of small cities when they’re running; shows like MAGIC (menswear apparel) and CES (computers and technology) easily attract over a hundred thousand attendees. In a typical (2009) show, CES features twenty-seven hundred exhibitors spanning thirty product categories. Approximately twenty thousand new products will launch at this event.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_006">International CES, <a class="link" href="http://www.cesweb.org/exhibitorDirectory/default.asp">http://www.cesweb.org/exhibitorDirectory/default.asp</a> (accessed July 12, 2008).</span> Trade shows are a major expenditure for companies; the typical mid- to large-size firm spends well over half a million dollars each year to display at shows. That’s a lot of free T-shirts, tote bags, and sore feet by the end of the day.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s02_p03">Despite the appeal of these shows where freebies, parties, and networking (and the occasional drunk conventioneer) abound, there are alternatives to these massive schmoozefests. As travel costs continue to escalate along with concerns about the sizeable carbon footprint that a hundred thousand people create when they converge on convention sites like Las Vegas, some industries are starting to experiment with virtual trade shows that you attend from your desktop. Both IBM and Cisco are proponents of this alternative.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s02_p04">Some of these virtual shows are accessible via Web sites that give you access to hundreds of exhibitors, job listings, and so on. Others are even more adventurous; they are held in virtual worlds where your avatar can wander among aisles of exhibitors, look at new products, dialogue in real time with company representatives, even taste the free hors d’oeuvres (well, maybe not quite yet). Startup companies like Unisfair are moving aggressively into this virtual space.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s02_p05">One of the biggest advantages of a virtual trade show is that the exhibitors can track the behavior of potential customers who visit the show.

This can be accomplished by identifying donations to charitable organizations, sponsorship of esteemed causes or events, contributions to individual, community, or societal well-being, and so on.</span></span> is to build good relationships with the advertiser’s publics, namely consumers, stockholders, legislators, and employees. We define PR as “communication that attempts to earn public understanding and acceptance of the firm by stressing the practices, policies, and procedures of an individual or the organization. This can be accomplished by identifying donations to charitable organizations, sponsorship of esteemed causes or events, contributions to individual, community, or societal well-being, and so on.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_008">Quoted in Stephen J. Grove, Les Carlson, and Michael J. Dorsch, “Comparing the Application of Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) in Magazine Ads Across Product Type and Time,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Advertising</em> 36, no. 1 (Spring 2007): 37.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s02_p02">Although it’s difficult to agree on a definition (depending who in the industry you ask), public relations frequently focuses on identifying and making public noteworthy information about clients, or creating newsworthy events for the purposes of heightening their clients’ public profiles. Traditionally, communications professionals have perceived public relations differently from advertising, which is persuasive, controlled content paid for by an identified sponsor. To the contrary, PR messages are not purchased and placed, or ultimately controlled, by clients. If news or information pieces originating with PR sources ultimately make it into the public discourse, it is presumably because the items warrant attention on their own merits and the original source of the information—the public relations professional—is obscured.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s02_p03">Today, distinctions between the disciplines are less clear-cut: frequently, advertising agencies are instrumental in trying to cultivate social networks and free, word-of-mouth exposure for their clients. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Guerrilla marketing</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix in which public relations professionals stage an event to “ambush” consumers with messages in places they’re not expecting to encounter them.</span></span>, like events staged by public relations professionals that “ambush” consumers with messages in places they’re not expecting to encounter them, can be effective ways of attracting highly valued news coverage for clients. Advertising agencies initiate and exploit consumer-generated content that is used for commercial purposes, thereby relinquishing control of the creative product in the process, much as PR professionals do when they issue press releases for editors to reformulate for their audiences. Some agencies take advantage of the relative anonymity of the Internet to develop positive chat and “consumer” reviews about their clients’ products—the source of content promoting products is not always clearly linked to an agency source, as public relations sources are seldom identified as the source of stories featuring their clients.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s02_s04_p01">As the Cartoon Network found out, publicity can cut both ways. Sometimes negative events happen to the company and the media reports these in great and glaring detail. Product defects, a serious accident at a company facility, management malfeasance, or major layoffs can tarnish the reputation of the firm.

The best way to do this is to have a <em class="emphasis">single spokesperson</em> talk with the media. This may mean “locking the business down” by asking everyone on the staff not to comment on the news story but to refer the question to the spokesperson so that the message is consistent and accurate. The most trustworthy spokesperson for the company is usually its CEO, because such high-level attention will show that the CEO stands behind the company.</p>

In addition to holding a press conference, Eckert filmed a separate online video apology. In his statements, he sympathized with parents, saying, “I’m a parent of four kids as well.” Mattel also took out full-page ads in major newspapers: the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>. Finally, Mattel’s Web site posted comprehensive recall details and explained how to receive a free replacement toy of equal value.

The main advantage of personal selling is the ability to tailor the message to the customer in real time, responding not only to their questions but also to their body language and tone. This type of direct contact lets the salesperson address customer concerns, sometimes even when the customer hasn’t voiced them aloud. Salespeople in fashion retail stores are ready (or at least they should be) with advice on how to accessorize an outfit or to help in deciding among outfits. Personal selling is even more important in products that are complex and require significant customer education or custom configuration. A sales force is a key part of medical products sales, information technology and solutions sales, or other complex products and services selling.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p01">Personal selling can also be done through an outside network of sales reps. For example, Barefoot Parties sells loungewear, accessories, and gifts for women through at-home parties held by its sales agents. Agents get bonuses based on the amount of income the party generates in addition to a minimum base commission of 20 percent from the party sales.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_012">Tim Parry, “Get in on the Party,” <em class="emphasis">Merchant</em>, January 1, 2007, n.p.</span></p>

Telecommunications equipment provider Lucent uses this kind of team approach, pairing supply chain executives with sales reps on the sales team. Technical specialists work with the customer to design a cell phone network, for example. In one case, Lucent created a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) cell phone network for a customer in India. The network included over fifty switching centers, twenty-five hundred base stations, and three hundred thousand circuit pack and cables. Such complexity demands a team sales approach.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s03_s03_p01">The disadvantages of personal selling are its high labor costs and the corollary: it’s difficult to reach large numbers of people when you try to speak them to one-to-one. Also, the information communicated may vary from the intended message. Sometimes salespeople, in an effort to “get the sale” or “go the extra mile” for their potential customer, may bend the rules in a way that’s detrimental for the company, such as by promising a delivery date that forces the company to pay extra in expediting costs or overtime in an effort to meet the promised date. Worse, a company might suffer bad publicity as a result of a salesperson’s unethical actions.</p>

The goal is to use information about individuals in order to present them with messages relevant to their needs and interests. The growth of consumer databases and improvement of technology and methods (such as advanced modeling and segmentation strategies) has led to increased use—and increased success—of direct marketing. For example, in the United States in 2006 direct marketing generated incremental sales of $1.93 trillion, which was 10 percent of the GDP. Each dollar spent on direct marketing yields, on average, an ROI (return on investment) of $11.65, compared to an ROI of $5.29 for traditional advertising.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_013">Direct Marketing Association, <em class="emphasis">The Power of Direct Marketing: ROI, Sales, Expenditures and Employment in the US, 2006–2007 Edition</em> (New York: DMA, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s04_p02">How does direct marketing fit into an integrated campaign? One application is to send a direct mail piece (usually a letter or package) to a targeted list of customers inviting them to visit a Web site where they can receive further information. For example, Pitney Bowes Mapinfo (a company that provides software and services to help business executives make location-based decisions, such as site selection) mailed executives one-half of a CD to drive the message that without the dimension of location, their analysis is not complete. The mail piece gave executives a Web address from which they could download a free white paper to learn more about location intelligence. Mapinfo combined the direct mail piece with banner ads on business-publication Web sites (such as BusinessWeek [<a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com">http://www.businessweek.com</a>], Forbes [<a class="link" href="http://www.forbes.com">http://www.forbes.com</a>], CNNMoney [<a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com">http://money.cnn.com</a>], and MSNMoney [<a class="link" href="http://moneycentral.msn.com">http://moneycentral.msn.com</a>]) to drive executives to the white paper. The result? Mapinfo received more than three thousand white paper downloads, of which more than 70 percent were senior management executives; more than thirteen hundred opt-ins to receive e-mail communications from MapInfo; and more than two hundred registrations for Mapinfo’s webinar.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_014">“Pitney Bowes Intelligently Plots Strategy for MapInfo,” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, August 13, 2007, 28.</span></p>

The campaign included direct mail, e-mail, telemarketing, and online marketing to drive potential new Sun customers to a Web site where they could register to win prizes in a sweepstakes. The campaign was a B2B (business-to-business) campaign in which Babcock &amp; Jenkins helped Sun deliver leads to its channel partners (namely the resellers who sell Sun systems). The campaign generated 120 percent more registrations than expected. The success was due in part to demographic profiling that identified potential customers and why they buy, and then used an integrated campaign to reinforce the messages and reach customers in different ways. “We use an approach we call connected strategy,” said Denise Barnes, president of Babcock &amp; Jenkins, “integrating direct mail, e-mail, telemarketing, banners, newsletters, print, microsites, events, podcasts, webcasts and social media into one-to-one communications for our clients.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_015">Kate Maddox, “Babcock &amp; Jenkins Focuses on Database-Driven Marketing; Runner-up Direct Agency of the Year,” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, October 9, 2006, 30.</span></p>

If you use Microsoft’s search engine it calls Live Search, the company keeps a record of the words you search for and the results you clicked on. Microsoft’s behavioral targeting system will allow its advertising clients to send different ads to each person surfing the Web. For instance, if a twenty-five-year-old financial analyst living in a big city is comparing prices of cars online, BMW could send her an ad for a Mini Cooper.
