        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s01_p01">The decision to purchase a product has five stages, each of which implies the need for a different type of communication. The five stages are:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Need recognition</a><span class="glossdef">The first step in the buying decision process; the realization that we have a need for a product.</span></span>: first, we realize we have a need for a product.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s01_p02">Advertisers can help consumers through the decision-making process. Some ads intend to create awareness that a need exists (it was an adman, not a doctor, who invented the term “halitosis” to describe bad breath!). Other ads provide information to facilitate information search and comparisons. Progressive Insurance, for example, lets customers shop online and compare prices among major competitors. The company does not promise to have the lowest price, but it makes clear what its price is in relation to the competition. This is particularly helpful in the “evaluation of alternatives” stage as customers compare different competitive offerings.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_013">Nancy Michael, “Customer Loyalty: Elusive, but Critical,” <em class="emphasis">ABA Banking Journal</em> 99, no. 2 (2007): 42.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Who Decides?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s02_p01">The people who make the purchase decision can be individuals, couples, families, or businesses. In businesses, the “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">buying center</a><span class="glossdef">A group of people in a business who are involved in the decision-making process for corporate purchases.</span></span>” (a group of people tasked with making purchase decisions on behalf of the organization) typically is involved in the decision-making process because organizational decisions are more complex. Each member of the buying center plays a different role in the process, which may require different types of messages. For example, new corporate computer software might advertise how it enhances business performance for managers while it emphasizes technical sophistication for IT professionals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s02_p02">SS+K’s client, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, has many audiences ranging from individuals to small businesses to national accounts (companies with over five hundred people, sometimes in multiple states). The agency recently designed a campaign to address the needs of national accounts business decision makers (the HR or corporate group in charge of making insurance decisions for a corporation.)</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s02_p03">Ariba, a provider of procurement and spending management software and services, sells to organizations such as banks. Ariba has learned that marketing to banks means understanding their priorities and challenges. Banks tend to be more conservative in their software purchase decisions because buying software often requires being able to roll it out across different branch locations. Purchasing agents at banks want to know if the manufacturer will support the product across locations and if it can be scaled quickly to other regions or departments. They want to know that the software will improve their bottom line and that others have deployed it successfully.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_014">Roger Slavens, “Understand Client Priorities, Then Deliver Solutions” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, March 12, 2007, 24.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s02_p04">Interview people whose jobs include the responsibility of purchasing items for their businesses to use. Ask them how they go about making these decisions, and what information sources they consult in this process.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Involvement and Perceived Risk</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p01">One important driver is a consumer’s extent of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">involvement</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of thought and effort a consumer puts into a buying decision.</span></span> with a brand or product category. It’s tempting to assume that we put more thought into purchases that are expensive, but this isn’t necessarily true. We might be motivated to put a great deal of thought and effort into choosing even a relatively cheap product if we feel our choice will reflect something about ourselves to others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p02">And involvement often is a function of the product’s degree of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perceived risk</a><span class="glossdef">The potential physical, financial, or social drawbacks that a consumer can imagine in making the wrong buying decision.</span></span>:</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Heuristics: Rules of Thumb</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s03_s02_p01">Hershey or Nestlé? Coke or Pepsi? Charmin or Bounty? Lil Wayne or Usher?

These rules simplify the decision-making process by making it quick and easy. Common heuristics include these:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Save the most money</em>. Many people follow a rule like, “I’ll buy the lowest-priced choice so that I spend the least money right now.” Using this heuristic means you don’t need to look beyond the price tag to make a decision. Wal-Mart built a retailing empire by pleasing shoppers who follow this rule.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">You get what you pay for</em>. Others might use the opposite heuristic, namely, “I’ll buy the more expensive product, because higher price often means better quality.” These consumers are influenced by ads alluding to exclusivity, quality, and uncompromising performance.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Stick to the tried and true</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Brand loyalty</a><span class="glossdef">A heuristic that simplifies the decision-making process for consumers: they buy the brand that they’ve always bought before.</span></span> also simplifies the decision-making process—we buy the brand that we’ve always bought before, and thus we don’t need to spend more time and effort on the decision. It’s hard to downplay the importance of brand loyalty—and of the role that advertising plays in creating and maintaining it. In a study of the market leaders in thirty product categories, twenty-seven of the brands that were number one in 1930 (such as Ivory Soap and Campbell’s Soup) still were at the top over fifty years later.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_016">Richard W. Stevenson, “The Brands with Billion-Dollar Names,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 28, 1988, A1.</span> Clearly “choose a well-known brand name” is a powerful heuristic.</li>

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s04_s03_s02_p02">Some purchases matter to us a lot more than others, so it makes sense that we don’t devote the same amount of attention to advertising for every idea, product, or service. An advertiser needs to appreciate how involved her customers are likely to be; we are more likely to search out detailed information for products that are highly involving to us. In other cases we tend to fall back on heuristics, “rules of thumb” that reflect well-learned rules (such as “it must be better if it costs more”).</p>
