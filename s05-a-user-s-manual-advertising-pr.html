    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p02">Hammers and screwdrivers did the trick for years, but today marketing communications professionals have a whole new box of power tools. The marketing to-do list is long and so is the list of instructions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p03">Agencies and their clients sorted madly through the box for the past decade as they tried to find the most effective tools for the job. Now, an avalanche of new technology adds to an increasingly daunting pile. It’s hard for some experienced advertising professionals to let go of what they “know.” “There’s still a little fear out there about shifting away from the traditional marketing tactics,” said Doug Scott, executive director for branded content and entertainment for the North American operations of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, in 2006.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_001">Stuart Elliott, “Nike Reaches Deeper into New Media to Find Young Buyers,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> <em class="emphasis">Online</em>, October 31, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/31/business/media/31adco.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;fta=y&amp;pagewanted=print">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/31/business/media/31adco.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;fta=y&amp;pagewanted=print</a> (accessed January 30, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p04">But some marketers get it. They understand that advertising is a key driver of popular culture in addition to just reflecting what is going on in our world. Think about Burger King, for example: How does a company that sells dead meat sandwiches and strips of deep-fried potatoes dig its way deep into popular consciousness and (dare we say it?) actually become cool? As CEO John Chidsey (who refers to himself as Chief Whopper Flipper) explains, “We want to stay on the cutting edge of pop culture.” How cool is it to sell more than three million Burger King–branded Xbox video games in two months? Or to get its creepy icon The King included in seventeen skits on Jay Leno in the same amount of time? How about having a highly visited profile on MySpace, or posting your menu as a video on YouTube (<a class="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/7-QFQOfkZ1k">http://www.youtube.com/v/7-QFQOfkZ1k</a>)?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_002">Quoted in Bruce Horovitz, “Burger King of Cool?” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, February 6, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2007-02-06-burger-king-usat_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2007-02-06- burger-king-usat_x.htm</a> (accessed July 3, 2008).</span> There’s something more than basic burger ads going on here.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p05">Fifteen years ago, we defined advertising agencies by the essential tools they used: television commercials, radio spots, billboards, print ads. But today traditional advertising approaches, even in the hands of our most skilled and lauded practitioners, are no longer good enough.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p06">Before we see how things are changing, let’s back up and start with a traditional definition: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Nonpersonal communication from an identified sponsor intended to inform consumers or persuade or remind them to buy a certain product or service.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">is nonpersonal communication from an identified sponsor that intends to inform, persuade, and/or remind</em>. Now let’s break that down a bit so we understand what advertising is—and how it differs from other forms of marketing communication:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_l02">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Advertising is nonpersonal communication</em>: The message gets delivered through one or more forms of paid mass media such as television or billboards.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Advertising comes from an identified sponsor</em>: Whether or not we pay attention to the message, we know who sent it.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Advertising informs</em>: Some messages try to make consumers aware of a product, service, or specific brand. You won’t choose a specific MP3 player until you know what it is and believe it’s better than listening to music on a CD player.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Advertising persuades</em>: Some messages try to change our opinion or motivate us to take action. You might decide to buy a Toyota Scion after you see a cool ad for it while you’re watching <em class="emphasis">American Idol</em>.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Advertising reminds</em>: Some messages try to encourage us to keep buying what we already like and use. “Got milk?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p07">Later we’ll talk about other kinds of marketing communication (such as sales promotions) and see how they differ from advertising. For now, suffice it to say that the lines are blurring and the tried and true is no longer so true. For example, while it’s mostly accurate to say that advertising comes from nonpersonal communications sources, today some companies recruit “brand ambassadors” who literally become walking billboards for their brands. They may get a tattoo of the company’s logo, or in some cases (we’re not making this up) name their children after a brand in exchange for some kind of payment. Or, consider the growing use of <em class="emphasis">human directionals</em>, which is what the advertising industry calls people who twirl signs outside restaurants, barbershops, and new real estate subdivisions. Southern California in particular has become a mecca for this new “sport” as locals cook up new moves to out-style their competitors. These include the Helicopter, in which a spinner does a backbend on one hand while he twirls a sign above his head. Then there’s the popular Spanking the Horse, where the human directional puts the advertising sign between his legs, slaps his own behind, and giddy-ups.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_003">Alana Semuels, “The Fine Art of Making a Point: ‘Human Directionals’—Those Guys Spinning Advertising Arrows—Can Cost $60 an Hour. Some of Their Best Moves Are Filed in the Patent Office,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, May 1, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.Latimes.Com/Business/La-Fi-Spinners1may01,0,7358645">http://www.Latimes.Com/Business/La-Fi-Spinners1may01,0,7358645</a> (accessed July 8, 2008).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p08">In addition, it’s no longer necessarily crystal clear just who (if anyone) is the sponsor of a message. For example, we’ll learn later about some <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">guerrilla marketing</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix in which public relations professionals stage an event to “ambush” consumers with messages in places they’re not expecting to encounter them.</span></span> tactics that involve paid performers who impersonate everyday people and endorse products in public places. No, you’re not paranoid—they really <em class="emphasis">are</em> trying to fake you out. Finally, as we’ll see, the Web is in some ways taking the “mass” out of “mass media.” New technologies allow advertisers to customize messages so that (literally) each person who sees an ad actually gets a personalized communication that reflects his or her own unique interests and past purchases.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p09">However, these innovative (and sort of scary) techniques remain in the minority of advertising efforts—at least for now. The reality is that most advertising agencies (and their clients) have been sleeping with their eyes open. According to an online survey of 184 marketers recently cited in the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, “Less than 24 percent of those polled considered their companies ‘digitally savvy,’ citing several issues, including ‘lack of experience in new media’ and ‘dearth of digital talent.’”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_004">Suzanne Vranica, “Password to Marketers’ Meeting: Digital Survey Finds Spending Is Weak Despite Change in Consumer Behavior,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, October 11, 2007, B6.</span> Still, the world of advertising is changing rapidly—and you’ll be in the forefront of that change.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p10">What is happening to advertising?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p11">Transformation. A melding of forms and disciplines. Evolution of species.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p12">Despite conventional definitions and expectations, we need to understand that advertising isn’t just about ads. Messages that sell may not originate with marketers or agencies, but rather with <em class="emphasis">you</em>. Marketing messages may not be paid for by advertisers. They are multinational and multidimensional, providing any combination of information, identity, and entertainment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p13">They don’t stay in place. Today, most any place is ad space (maybe even your own forehead!). By emphasizing the visual and experiential, today’s advertising messages are difficult to analyze critically. By incorporating authentic experience and online collaboration, new marketing is very difficult to predict and control. An old Chinese curse says, “May you live in interesting times.” We do.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p14">There is a fundamental change in the advertising vehicles themselves as media and technology converge. Traditional radio is losing share to digital options, online “television” viewing is increasingly popular, and marketers continue to divert print dollars to online budgets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_005">“Traditional Radio’s Digital Competition Increases in Q4,” <a class="link" href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/radio/traditional-radios-digital-competition-increases-in-q4-2125">http://www.marketingcharts.com/radio/traditional-radios-digital- competition-increases-in-q4-2125</a> (accessed January 30, 2009).</span> Once thought to be a specialized type of advertising, now interactive/online approaches often are a fundamental way to engage consumers—especially younger digital natives who have grown up on MySpace, IM, and YouTube. Yet in an article on how advertisers seek less intrusive, more measurable ways to deliver online messages, the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> reports, “Many sites and advertisers remain in the throes of experimentation, with mixed or disappointing results to date. Some say the industry hasn’t yet figured out how to make video ads as interactive and effective as they can be.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_006">Kevin J. Delaney and Emily Steel, “Are Skins, Bugs or Tickers the Holy Grail of Web Advertising?” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, August 13, 2007, B1.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p15">Clients are similarly challenged. They no longer have the luxury of telling you only what they want you to know about their brand. Today, you can ask your neighbor or a Norwegian sitting in an Internet café while he’s vacationing in Majorca about that new bottled water you’ve been thinking about trying—all you need to do is type in a few well-chosen key words on your Google search bar and you’re off to the races.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p16">It didn’t take long for some forward-thinking marketers to ask how they could use blogs for their own purposes. However, as recently as 2006 a poll showed just how far most <em class="emphasis">Fortune 1000</em> executives have to go to catch up with the consumers with whom they hope to engage in dialogue. Only 30 percent said they understood the meaning of the term <em class="emphasis">Internet blog</em>, while 12 percent reported their companies had resorted to legal action to stop a blog that someone else had posted about their company!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_007">“<em class="emphasis">Fortune 1000</em> Senior Executives’ Opinions Regarding Blogs and Their Company,” <a class="link" href="http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6832426/Fortune-1000-senior-executives-opinions.html">http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6832426/Fortune- 1000-senior-executives-opinions.html</a> (accessed July 3, 2008).</span> The executives know there is a new tool out there. Most don’t understand or use it themselves. But their first instinct is that it must be reined in and controlled.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p17">Like many marketers now, they battle twin fears: being late to the game and lacking the proper skills required to play. The danger is in choosing nontraditional routes uncritically because they have the cachet of being on the “bleeding edge.” According to Marc Schiller, chief executive of the digital-marketing shop Electric Artists, “There is always this pressure of saying we weren’t early enough on MySpace. We weren’t early enough on Facebook.…Suddenly there is this herd mentality and people are doing it because they feel like if they are not there, they are missing out.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_008">Emily Steel, “Marketers Explore New Virtual Worlds. Some Create Own as Second Life Site Loses Some Luster,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, October 23, 2007, B9.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p18">A word of caution: in a business like advertising that prides itself on cultural currency, there is always a temptation to choose interactive solutions solely because you can. Sometimes, however, the best answer to a marketing problem is as low-tech and simple as the vivid yellow LIVE<strong class="emphasis bold">STRONG</strong> bands on your friends’ wrists. But before we talk about where we’re going, let’s talk about where we’ve been.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_p19">It’s time to take a step back and first learn a bit about where advertising came from and how many organizations still do it today.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Some Quick Background and History</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Advertising has been with us since the days of ancient Greece, when announcements were etched on stone tablets or shouted by town criers. While Pizza Hut painted its logo on a Russian rocket and delivered a pizza to the Mir Space Station, in reality many of the ad formats we see today haven’t fundamentally changed in hundreds of years.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_009">“Cosmonaut to Tee Up for Monster Orbital Golf Shot (Reuters),” <em class="emphasis">NowPublic</em>, November 18, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.nowpublic.com/cosmonaut_to_tee_up_for_monster_orbital_golf_shot_reuters">http://www.nowpublic.com/cosmonaut_to_tee_up_ for_monster_orbital_golf_shot_reuters</a> (accessed February 13, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Advertising in the United States began before we were even a nation. Colonial Americans saw ads on posters and in newspapers—the first newspaper ad was for real estate and appeared in 1704. For a comprehensive timeline covering the history of advertising, check out <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/century/timeline/index.html">http://adage.com/century/timeline/index.html</a>. The true rise of modern advertising, however, coincided with the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Industrial Revolution</a><span class="glossdef">A period in the early nineteenth century when the economic system based on manual labor gave way to the modern system of producing goods in factories.</span></span> for three reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Technologies enabled mass production of consumer goods, which meant that companies could grow to a larger size and make many more products efficiently. Next, they needed to find ways to sell these goods.</li>
            <li>Railroads linked the nation and provided a way to get newspapers and mass-produced products into towns across America. Quaker Oats—the first mass-marketed breakfast food—was introduced in 1878. Ivory Soap followed in 1879, and in 1888 Eastman began advertising the first hand-held Kodak cameras.</li>
            <li>The same technologies that enabled mass production accelerated the growth of mass media. The invention of the rotary press in 1859 and the process of making paper from wood pulp developed in 1866 enabled mass production of newspapers, which in turn provided the medium to distribute ads to more people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s01_p03">Early examples of mass media include the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, which published its first issue in 1851 (it was then called the <em class="emphasis">New-York Daily Times</em>). The <em class="emphasis">New York Tribune</em> doubled its advertising between October 1849 and October 1850. The magazines <em class="emphasis">Harper’s Bazaar</em> and <em class="emphasis">Vanity Fair</em> debuted in 1867 and 1868, respectively. By 1870, 5,091 newspapers were in circulation in the United States.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s01_p04">Capitalism also fueled advertising as it created a growing middle class that could afford to buy an array of consumer products. Soon the proliferation of mass-distributed consumer goods sparked the rise of the advertising profession. As competing manufacturers grew and more products were available on the market, the need to distinguish one’s products from the rest of the pack created a need for professional advertising agents, and advertising grew from an emerging to a legitimate profession. In 1890, the J. Walter Thompson Company (the oldest continuously operating advertising agency in the United States) had billings totaling over $1 million (in those days, a million was still a lot of money!).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Advertising/Promotion</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s02_p01">Today, the realm of advertising has expanded vastly beyond newspapers—way beyond. Consider Target’s recent ads that entertained passersby at New York’s Grand Central Station. The retailer showcased its designer apparel in a spooky fashion show that repeated every ten minutes; it used <em class="emphasis">holograms</em> (two-dimensional moving images that give the illusion of having three dimensions) to project images of garments (sans models) prancing down a surreal runway.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_010">Ann Zimmerman, “Target Campaign Goes ‘Model-Less,’” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, October 29, 2007, B4.</span> Yes, we’ve come a long way from stone etchings.</p>

This online migration makes the Web where the action is for many advertisers.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Is Traditional Advertising Dead?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s03_p01">We’ve seen that advertisers have many, many more weapons in their arsenal than they used to. With all of these exciting options available, it’s tempting to conclude that traditional methods like a TV commercial or a magazine space ad are history. Is traditional advertising dead?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s01_s03_p02">Don’t write an obituary for traditional advertising—at least not yet. It’s true that fewer people may be watching TV, especially the major networks, but TV is still the medium that reaches the greatest number of people at the same time. That’s why advertisers continue to pay top dollar to make and air TV commercials. But the industry is shifting from the sell-and-tell mindset that traditionally prevailed in broadcast and print media. The new mindset engages people in a conversation. This perspective understands that advertising needs to show customers how a product will satisfy their needs—and do it better than the competition. Broadcast media builds awareness of a brand, but, as SS+K’s Rob Shepardson says, awareness is only “the first step of the process.” Advertising and promotion must now build the relationship, too. Understanding the components of this relationship is part of the marketing discipline. Let’s turn to that next.</p>

Others even think of it in a very negative way, as in, “That’s not really true. It’s just marketing.” In reality, marketing relates to both advertising and selling, but it’s not the same thing as either term. And let’s hope the second perspective isn’t true!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s02_p03">According to the American Marketing Association, “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Marketing</a><span class="glossdef">The processes involved in creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value.</span></span> is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_015">MarketingPower.com, “Marketing Definitions,” <a class="link" href="http://www.marketingpower.com/content4620.php">http://www.marketingpower.com/content4620.php</a> (accessed April 17, 2008).</span> That’s a pretty long-winded definition—but when you boil it down, it basically means that marketing is about all parties to a transaction walking away with something of value. Thus, marketers ideally try to satisfy everyone involved in the process, including those who make a product or promote an idea, those who advertise it, and those who purchase it or endorse it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s02_p04">And the process is in many ways the same regardless of what the transaction is about—whether it’s a can of peas, a reggae concert, a blood drive, or a political campaign. In each case marketing is about satisfying needs. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">need</a><span class="glossdef">The difference between a consumer’s actual state and some ideal or desired state.</span></span> is the difference between a consumer’s actual state and some ideal or desired state. For example, if you drive a junky old car but you crave a hot ride, you have a need. If you know that a poor child in a third world country goes without proper food and you believe she should have access to healthy meals, you also have a need.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s02_p05">Most successful organizations today practice the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing concept</a><span class="glossdef">The process in which marketers first identify customers’ needs and then provide products or services that satisfy those needs.</span></span>; marketers first identify customers’ needs and then provide products or services that satisfy those needs.

It probably won’t surprise you to learn that a lot of advertising tries to show consumers just how a product, service, or idea will do a good job of satisfying a need as it informs, persuades, or reminds.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s02_p06">Advertising is one important element in the marketer’s strategic toolbox. We call this toolbox the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing mix</a><span class="glossdef">The tools the organization uses to create a desired response among a set of predefined consumers.</span></span>, which consists of the tools the organization uses to create a desired response among a set of predefined consumers.

We commonly refer to the elements of the marketing mix as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Four Ps</a><span class="glossdef">Product, place, price, and promotion.</span></span>: <em class="emphasis">product</em>, <em class="emphasis">place</em>, <em class="emphasis">price</em>, and <em class="emphasis">promotion</em>. The word <em class="emphasis">mix</em> reminds us that no single marketing activity is sufficient to accomplish the organization’s objectives; the key is to blend these together to create the desired impact. Let’s take a closer look at each of these four basic tools.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch02_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Product</h2>

Sometimes the “product” can even be a person, such as a political candidate. SS+K’s work for (now President) Barack Obama certainly illustrates that idea. A product may consist of a single item, such as a printer, or a portfolio of interrelated items such as a package that includes a printer, specialized software, and online photo-sharing services.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s02_s01_p02">It’s important to remember that the product you sell is a lot more than the physical item the company manufactures. We also have to think about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">augmented products</a><span class="glossdef">Aspects of the product or service that help the consumer to use the core product, such as a warranty or an instruction book.</span></span>; aspects of the product or service that help the consumer to use the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">core product</a><span class="glossdef">The basic good or service that is being sold.</span></span>.

That was nice last year, but I want the packaging to be refreshing.’” Unilever’s innovative packaging includes Axe shower gel bottles shaped like video-game joysticks.</p>

The goal is to convince the customers that they want a product, in order to create a “pull” demand in which the customer goes to a store and asks for the product by name.

The company is testing a grocery cart–mounted console that helps shoppers find products in the store, then scan and pay for their items without waiting in the checkout line. As they shop, consumers will see video ads playing on these cart screens. But it gets better: Before they leave home, customers with a ShopRite loyalty card log into a Web site and type in their grocery lists. They go to the store and swipe their card on the cart, and the list appears. As they scan their purchases and put them in their cart, they get a running price tally, and their shopping list automatically checks off these items. The system also can sense where the cart is in the store so it can send ads to shoppers just when they wheel by certain key areas—for example, the cart might offer a discount on Lay’s potato chips at the exact moment they walk by the potato chip section.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_016">Jessica Mintz, “Cart Console Finds Grocery Items for You,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2008-01-14-microsoft-shopping-carts_N.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2008-01-14-microsoft-shopping-carts_N.htm</a> (accessed February 13, 2009).</span> Price, product, promotion, and place—all in play.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p01">Some agencies focus on one aspect of the creative process, such as creative production work or media buying.

These agency partners all contributed to the msnbc.com campaign led by SS+K.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p02">Some companies prefer to retain control over advertising and set up <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">in-house agencies</a><span class="glossdef">Agencies set up within the corporation, typically run by an advertising director who chooses which services to buy and which to perform internally.</span></span> within the corporation. An advertising director typically runs the in-house agency; she chooses which services to buy and which to perform internally. For example, the in-house agency could retain creative services in house, create advertisements itself, and then purchase media-buying services from the outside. The inside agency may buy services from a specialized service agency or buy services à la carte from a full service agency.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p03">Why bother to form an in-house agency? The two main reasons are to save the company money and to give the company greater control over the entire process. In addition, internal employees may have a deeper understanding of the company and its customers than would an outside agency. Insiders can also coordinate the promotion better with the firm’s overall marketing program and other functions, such as ensuring that enough products are made and delivered in advance of a promotion. Target works with their in-house agency as well as with outside agencies. They do not have an outside agency of record.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p04">Agencies also clarify their specializations in terms of location; SS+K, for example, is a U.S. agency. Some agencies are considered global agencies, such as JWT, TBWA, BBDO, and others. These agencies have offices worldwide and specialize in clients whose audiences are worldwide, such as MasterCard (McCann Worldwide is the agency).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p01">In addition to the types of agencies, there is also the role that the agency plays in the client’s business.

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p02">The traditional approach to farm out different functions may change if some big clients get their way. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Dell are but two of several major advertisers that are dissatisfied with this strategy. More specifically, they join Procter &amp; Gamble and others to call for more collaboration between the people who do the consumer research and the people who actually create the ads. In most cases, separate companies carry out communications planning and creative functions, so coordination can be difficult, and self-serving biases may color some decisions. For example, an advertising agency might be tempted to suggest a network television campaign because it would be involved in creating the ads (and billing more in the process). Instead, advertisers prefer a <em class="emphasis">media-agnostic</em> approach, where the agency picks whatever medium works best for a specific campaign. We saw earlier that SS+K strongly endorses this philosophy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s02_p01">Historically, an agency receives a commission or percentage of the cost of the media it buys for the client. Traditionally, mass media has paid advertising agencies a 15 percent commission on all business brought to them. The commission covers the agency’s copywriting, art direction, and account service charges. Today, this compensation model makes less sense because many advertising services no longer include a traditional media buy.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s02_p02">The straight 15 percent commission is still used in some cases, but some agencies charge less than 15 percent, or have sliding scales based on how much the client spends (the more money spent, the lower the percentage fee). Some agencies offer flat-fee arrangements that clients and the agency agree upon, while others charge on an hourly basis. Others will do a combination of a flat base fee plus smaller percentages per media. Interactive media currently charges the highest commission because it requires the most management time from agency personnel.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s02_p03">Other innovative models include licensing fees or royalties for ideas. Some even use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">performance fees</a><span class="glossdef">A system of payment in which the agency’s fee depends on the success of the campaign.</span></span>, in which the agency’s fee depends on the success of the campaign. The client and the agency define what they mean by “success” at the start; they might measure this by looking at how well consumers recall the ads or might measure actual product sales. Agencies using performance-based models can earn much more—or much less—than the standard 15 percent commission. The rationale, however, is that the compensation would be tied to the <em class="emphasis">value</em> of the ideas. As we’ll see later, the question of just how—and whether—we should quantify the effect of advertising is one of the burning issues the industry faces.</p>

This is the very question faced by any company that wishes to compete in today’s highly competitive laptop computer market. Two heavyweight competitors, Lenovo and Apple, are betting that their products will win the market share race in the laptop market. Lenovo has the superthin ThinkPad X300 positioned against Apple’s MacBook Air. Comparison tables show that each of these highly desirable products has very similar features and characteristics with a slight positive edge going to the ThinkPad X300. Prices are also similar. Considering the facts you have been given and the types of advertising and promotion discussed in this chapter, <em class="emphasis">recommend</em> the forms of advertising and promotion that Lenovo should use to exploit its slight advantage over Apple’s product. Be sure to consider whom you would address with your message and the best way to reach them as you write your recommendation.</li>
            <li>Let’s assume that you and a few close friends have just invented a new video game that has all the people you know raving about it. It’s a spin-off from the wildly popular <em class="emphasis">Guitar Hero</em> concept where the music player can become a keyboardist (keyboard sold with game unit), bass player, or drummer (complete with drumsticks and simulated drumhead pad).

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch02_s04_p02">Most consumers are familiar with the term <em class="emphasis">advertising agency</em>; however, most would be hard pressed to explain exactly what an advertising agency does or even name some of the most prominent agencies. Surprisingly, most advertising agencies do not toot their own horns to the general public. The exact opposite is true with respect to courting potential clients. Advertising agencies are extremely competitive with one another and have different ways of communicating their messages to prospective clients. Today, a solid Web presence is a necessity for any advertising agency. Some take the familiar “listing of services” approach and others take a more creative approach.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Ethical Dilemma</h3>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch02_s04_p04">Traditionally, the mass media has paid advertising agencies a 15 percent commission on all business brought to them. The advertising agency also represents a client and may receive fees from that client. Since the advertising agency receives a commission on the amount billed from a client from the mass media, some believe that a conflict of interest exists—two masters are being served. While the advertising agency is supposedly cutting the best deal they can with the mass media for their client in terms of media prices, they may also be receiving commissions based on billing where more money is made by the advertising agency as billing revenues for the agency and mass media increase.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch02_s04_p05">After considering the ethics of this situation, take a position on the practice and make comments. Remember to try to see the issue from the viewpoint of all parties—the mass media, the client, and the advertising agency. Be prepared to discuss your thoughts and position.</p>
