            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s01_p01">In 2007, Japanese auto maker Suzuki began aggressively targeting a new segment: female car buyers in India who now have the income to buy their own vehicles due to India’s economic boom. The carmaker’s Zen Estilo (Estilo means “style” in Spanish) sells for less than $8,000 and comes in eight colors, including “purple fusion,” “virgin blue,” and “sparkling olive.” For a more modern look, Suzuki gave the car a two-tone dashboard and a front grille design that makes the little car look like it is smiling. Style-conscious drivers can also add rear spoilers, side skirts, and extra colors to the body. Many of Suzuki’s foreign competitors ignored this market because they chose to focus on selling mid- to high-end vehicles.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_018">Eric Bellman, “Suzuki’s Stylish Compacts Captivate India’s Women,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, May 11, 2007, B1.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Behavioral Targeting: Advertisers Know What You Like (Like It or Not)</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s02_p01">The STP process is evolving rapidly as new advances in technology enable advertisers to identify and reach consumers where they live, work, and especially surf (online).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s02_p02">Today, companies define and manage finer and finer segments. In the past, segments had to be broad because it was difficult to reach finer-level segments and because such fine-grain data were not available. Now, companies can process terabytes of data on customers, and new ad channels (such as keyword advertising on the Internet) allow companies to reach smaller segments, down to segments of one (yes, like you).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s02_p03">These three factors fuel the accelerating trend of targeting small, very well-defined segments:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Growing volume of data on customers</li>
            <li>Rising use of computers and analytic software</li>
            <li>Increasing specificity of advertising channels (e.g., keyword advertising on the Internet)</li>

It’s become fairly easy for marketers to tailor the ads you see based on prior Web sites you’ve visited. The logic is inescapable: you’re more likely to respond (and probably appreciate) an ad for an idea, product, or service that’s relevant to your needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s02_p05">Obviously, privacy concerns arise as advertisers learn more about the sites we visit. But many consumers seem more than happy to trade off some of their personal information in exchange for information they consider more useful to them. More than half of respondents in one recent survey said they’re willing to provide demographic information in exchange for a personalized online experience.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_019">“Consumers Willing to Trade Off Privacy for Electronic Personalization,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Daily</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com">http://www.mediapost.com</a> (accessed January 23, 2007).</span> While the ethics of gathering personal information are still being evaluated, behavioral targeting is the next frontier for many advertisers.</p>

            <li>When you (along with 263 million other users) sign up for Microsoft’s free e-mail service called Hotmail, the service asks you for personal information including your age, occupation, and address (though you’re not required to answer). If you use Microsoft’s Live Search search engine, the company keeps a records of the words you search for and the results you clicked on. Microsoft’s behavioral targeting system will allow its advertising clients to send different ads to each person surfing the Web. For instance, if a twenty-five-year-old financial analyst living in a big city is comparing prices of cars online, BMW could send her an ad for a Mini Cooper. But it could send a forty-five-year-old suburban businessman with children, who is doing the same search, an ad for the X5 SUV.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn06_020">Aaron O.

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s02_p06">Behavioral targeting allows advertisers to identify our consumption practices so that they can tailor ads to our precise interests. They argue that this technology increases efficiency, saves money, and reduces advertising bloat because we won’t be bombarded with commercial messages for products we don’t want. On the other hand, critics of this practice argue that we’re “making a deal with the devil” because we’re giving companies access to our personal behaviors. This controversy has surfaced on Facebook, which is now sharing data about users’ online behaviors with advertisers. What is the current status of this conflict? How can advertisers do a better job of targeting while respecting the privacy of consumers—especially those who don’t <em class="emphasis">want</em> to be targeted?</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch06_s02_s02_p10">To refine their understanding of how to develop the msnbc.com proposition, SS+K enlisted the aid of Energy Infuser, a market research company in Chicago that specializes in unearthing consumer insights through qualitative methods such as focus groups, projective techniques, and consumer diaries. A number of “triads” (groups of three consumers) were recruited and agreed to offer their time and consumer experiences of online information seeking. Through analysis of the group’s transcripts, the SS+K team developed a better sense of why a user might choose msnbc.com over other options: relative to competitors like bland news aggregators and “cold” and “serious” CNN.com, msnbc.com virtually sparkled with energy and personality. The site was inviting for users who enjoyed browsing for news and tidbits, including lighthearted information on entertainment, fashion, and sports.</p>
