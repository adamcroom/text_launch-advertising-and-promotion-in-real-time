<span class="title-prefix">13.1</span> msnbc.com: A Campaign Portfolio</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch13_s01_p01">The campaign consisted of many interrelated pieces. All of them tied back to the major campaign objective of building a solid and positive brand image for msnbc.com. SS+K and its partners accomplished this by designing multiple executions using multiple platforms, from conventional print to innovations including the first-ever in-cinema game that allowed the audience to participate in the execution.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch13_s01_p02">In order to keep track of all these elements, SS+K referred to a <em class="emphasis">status chart</em>, a tool many agencies use to keep track of the progress of the many moving parts involved in a campaign. Status charts are tailored to specific account or campaign needs and are managed by the account management and project management teams.</p>
