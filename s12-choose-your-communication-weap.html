    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_p01">The advertiser’s toolbox is a deep one, and it’s expanding by leaps and bounds. Indeed, the problem often is to figure out which tool—or even better, <em class="emphasis">combination</em> of tools—will work best to solve a specific strategic issue. In the old days (say, fifteen to twenty years ago), agencies tended to have one approach that they used over and over for every client. Good at doing TV commercials? Shoot them for everyone. Specialize in outdoor? Roll out the poster boards. But yesterday’s “hammer in search of a nail” approach won’t cut it anymore.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_p02">Today it’s more common for agencies to think about themselves as being not so much in the advertising business as in the <em class="emphasis">communications</em> business. Sure, that’s just a word change—but the implications are huge. This switch is a constant reminder that we need to consider <em class="emphasis">any</em> way to communicate with customers that makes sense for that particular segment—and there’s often more than one way to skin a cat.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">integrated marketing communications perspective</a><span class="glossdef">A marketing strategy that blends many diverse elements so that the client’s message touches the customer in the same way regardless of <em class="emphasis">where</em> this interaction occurs.</span></span> emphasizes the careful, strategic blending of many diverse elements to be sure that the client’s message touches the customer in the same way regardless of <em class="emphasis">where</em> this interaction occurs. That sounds like plain common sense, but you’d be surprised how often it’s a problem—especially in an industry where a client might give its advertising business to one agency, hire a separate firm to handle its public relations, and have still another conduct sales promotions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_p04">Most major agencies today practice the integrated marketing approach in some way, often by starting new divisions to handle areas they didn’t tackle before, or buying (or allying with) smaller, specialized shops that are already experts. The client is ultimately accountable for managing its agencies in a way that supports its overall communications vision. For example, SS+K worked with msnbc.com’s search agency 360i to support the integrated branding campaign. (You’ll learn more about the way they worked together soon.) Marketers are the people most conscientious about coordinating all of the messages that customers receive, but they rely on their agencies to be vigilant about this as well. So, let’s summarize what an integrated perspective emphasizes:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch09_l01">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Use, and especially coordination, of all promotional tools available to support a communications strategy</em>. These include sales promotions, public relations, personal selling, and direct marketing, as well as advertisements.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Identification of the tools over and above traditional advertising at your disposal</em>. These might include placing branded billboards in videogames, dressing actors in costumes and having them take to the streets as “brand ambassadors,” or perhaps sending IMs to kids on their cell phones.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Creation of a coordinated promotional plan</em>. Such a plan starts by specifying communications objectives and then details how to reach each of these.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Maximization of resources</em>. Especially for small businesses, maximize available resources even when they are scarce. Repurposing ads and utilizing connections are strategies that maximize resources.</li>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_p05">All of us are better than each of us.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_p06">The point of strategic communication is to use the best tools available to effect the desired change in the marketplace. SS+K, like some other agencies, no longer draws hard-and-fast distinctions among functions such as advertising, promotions, direct marketing, and digital and public relations. SS+K’s goal is to achieve synergy among all the efforts that emanate from the msnbc.com brand—to choose the best tools for the job, not the ones that are most expected or familiar.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_p07">Compared to the “silos” that pervade some agencies, agency creative director Marty Cooke sees more value in combining disciplines than isolating them:</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_p08">“The basic core idea of SS+K…is to get the different disciplines of communications, writers, art directors, designers, planners, strategy people, researchers, public relations guys, public affairs guys, digital people, direct mail people, whoever else you need, around the table, the biggest brains you can get and let the sparks fly. And that’s been kind of the magic of this place ever since we started it, and it’s worked out very well.”—Marty Cooke, Agency Creative Director</p>

Part of the band’s appeal is the cult following for lead singer Hayley Williams (and legions of young girls imitating her shaggy blonde and orange hairstyle). But the group’s success is also due to a new business model in the music industry, where musicians work with their label to coordinate a marketing campaign that includes album sales, concert tickets, and merchandise. This model is called <em class="emphasis">multiple rights</em> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">“360” deals</a><span class="glossdef">A coordinated marketing campaign that includes album sales, concert tickets, and merchandise; also called <em class="emphasis">multiple rights</em>.</span></span>; the biggest to date is Madonna’s recent $120 million package with the concert promoter Live Nation.

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s01_p04">When Unilever introduced its All Small &amp; Mighty detergent, it used a traditional ad campaign (TV and print) to make the point that the new detergent is concentrated, packed in a smaller bottle to create a smaller ecofootprint while delivering the same results. In addition, Unilever handed out samples from a bus; it made the bus noticeable by draping it in laundry. Anyone who spotted the bus could also send a text message to enter a sweepstakes. Unilever also projected “videoscapes” onto buildings and did a product placement on <em class="emphasis">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em>, in which the studio audience did their laundry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_002">Sarah Heim, “The Spin Cycle,” <em class="emphasis">Adweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 22.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s01_p05">Campaigns that utilize multiple media platforms make a lot of sense, especially in today’s media environment. The simple truth is that consumers increasingly rely on a greater mix of media for news, entertainment, and product information. According to a late 2007 survey, 55 percent of consumers who watch TV watch some type of video on devices other than their TV sets, including their computers, mobile phones, and digital media players (e.g., iPod). Not surprisingly, video watching on these alternative devices is more popular among younger consumers (66 percent) than older ones (36 percent).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_003">Jack Loechner, “Over Half of Connected TV Viewers Also Watch on Alternative Devices,” <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=73291">http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.show Article&amp;art_aid=73291</a> (accessed January 2, 2008).</span></p>

The integrated program will include anything from advertising, consumer sales promotion, and trade promotions to public relations, personal selling, direct marketing, and more. The messaging works across platforms, and is also referred to as cross-platform marketing. Let’s look at each of these in turn.</p>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s01_p07">Traditional agencies tend to focus on what they do well, but customers touch clients’ products in many ways.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_p01">A sales promotion is activity intended to produce some short-term change in behavior.

                <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s01_s02_p03">By law, sweepstakes cannot be tied to a purchase, which means that any consumer can be eligible to win the prize if they fill out the entry form. Therefore, it’s best to use sweepstakes to build awareness of your brand, not to drive immediate sales. The sweepstakes should be cleverly tied to your brand. For example, if your product is canned pineapple, a sweepstakes with the grand prize of a trip to Hawaii makes sense. If your product is motor oil, a sweepstakes in which the grand prize is a chance to be on a NASCAR pit crew team is more relevant and effective than winning a lunch date with Hannah Montana (Danica Patrick is another story). Sweepstakes also offer an opportunity to generate publicity (discussed below) during a time when you are not introducing new products.</p>

Frequent flyer programs such as the United Airlines Mileage Plus program offer free miles to their customers with each flight they purchase. The more miles they fly per year, the bigger the bonus mileage. For example, customers who fly fifty thousand miles or more per year get double bonus miles (a hundred thousand miles or the equivalent of four free airline tickets in the United States) for the miles they’ve purchased. These loyalty programs offer additional perks, such as shorter lines, to their loyal customers.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p01">As consumers we probably don’t see many of the more aggressive promotions that companies sponsor.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p02">Trade promotions fall into two main categories: discount promotions and industry visibility. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Discount promotions</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix that encourages a trade partner to stock an item by offering a reduced cost or helping to defray the partner’s advertising expenses.</span></span> offer the trade partner a reduced cost on the product or help to defray the partner’s advertising expenses.

                    <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s02_p02">The trade show industry generates billions of dollars a year and affects the economies of many other sectors such as travel and hospitality. Some major trade shows dwarf the size of small cities when they’re running; shows like MAGIC (menswear apparel) and CES (computers and technology) easily attract over a hundred thousand attendees. In a typical (2009) show, CES features twenty-seven hundred exhibitors spanning thirty product categories. Approximately twenty thousand new products will launch at this event.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_006">International CES, <a class="link" href="http://www.cesweb.org/exhibitorDirectory/default.asp">http://www.cesweb.org/exhibitorDirectory/default.asp</a> (accessed July 12, 2008).</span> Trade shows are a major expenditure for companies; the typical mid- to large-size firm spends well over half a million dollars each year to display at shows.

                    <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s02_p03">Despite the appeal of these shows where freebies, parties, and networking (and the occasional drunk conventioneer) abound, there are alternatives to these massive schmoozefests. As travel costs continue to escalate along with concerns about the sizeable carbon footprint that a hundred thousand people create when they converge on convention sites like Las Vegas, some industries are starting to experiment with virtual trade shows that you attend from your desktop. Both IBM and Cisco are proponents of this alternative.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_s02_p04">Some of these virtual shows are accessible via Web sites that give you access to hundreds of exhibitors, job listings, and so on. Others are even more adventurous; they are held in virtual worlds where your avatar can wander among aisles of exhibitors, look at new products, dialogue in real time with company representatives, even taste the free hors d’oeuvres (well, maybe not quite yet). Startup companies like Unisfair are moving aggressively into this virtual space.</p>

Dorsch, “Comparing the Application of Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) in Magazine Ads Across Product Type and Time,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Advertising</em> 36, no. 1 (Spring 2007): 37.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s02_p02">Although it’s difficult to agree on a definition (depending who in the industry you ask), public relations frequently focuses on identifying and making public noteworthy information about clients, or creating newsworthy events for the purposes of heightening their clients’ public profiles. Traditionally, communications professionals have perceived public relations differently from advertising, which is persuasive, controlled content paid for by an identified sponsor. To the contrary, PR messages are not purchased and placed, or ultimately controlled, by clients. If news or information pieces originating with PR sources ultimately make it into the public discourse, it is presumably because the items warrant attention on their own merits and the original source of the information—the public relations professional—is obscured.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s02_p03">Today, distinctions between the disciplines are less clear-cut: frequently, advertising agencies are instrumental in trying to cultivate social networks and free, word-of-mouth exposure for their clients. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Guerrilla marketing</a><span class="glossdef">A tool in the promotional mix in which public relations professionals stage an event to “ambush” consumers with messages in places they’re not expecting to encounter them.</span></span>, like events staged by public relations professionals that “ambush” consumers with messages in places they’re not expecting to encounter them, can be effective ways of attracting highly valued news coverage for clients. Advertising agencies initiate and exploit consumer-generated content that is used for commercial purposes, thereby relinquishing control of the creative product in the process, much as PR professionals do when they issue press releases for editors to reformulate for their audiences. Some agencies take advantage of the relative anonymity of the Internet to develop positive chat and “consumer” reviews about their clients’ products—the source of content promoting products is not always clearly linked to an agency source, as public relations sources are seldom identified as the source of stories featuring their clients.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s03_s03_p01">The disadvantages of personal selling are its high labor costs and the corollary: it’s difficult to reach large numbers of people when you try to speak them to one-to-one. Also, the information communicated may vary from the intended message. Sometimes salespeople, in an effort to “get the sale” or “go the extra mile” for their potential customer, may bend the rules in a way that’s detrimental for the company, such as by promising a delivery date that forces the company to pay extra in expediting costs or overtime in an effort to meet the promised date. Worse, a company might suffer bad publicity as a result of a salesperson’s unethical actions.</p>

The goal is to use information about individuals in order to present them with messages relevant to their needs and interests. The growth of consumer databases and improvement of technology and methods (such as advanced modeling and segmentation strategies) has led to increased use—and increased success—of direct marketing. For example, in the United States in 2006 direct marketing generated incremental sales of $1.93 trillion, which was 10 percent of the GDP. Each dollar spent on direct marketing yields, on average, an ROI (return on investment) of $11.65, compared to an ROI of $5.29 for traditional advertising.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_013">Direct Marketing Association, <em class="emphasis">The Power of Direct Marketing: ROI, Sales, Expenditures and Employment in the US, 2006–2007 Edition</em> (New York: DMA, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s04_p02">How does direct marketing fit into an integrated campaign? One application is to send a direct mail piece (usually a letter or package) to a targeted list of customers inviting them to visit a Web site where they can receive further information. For example, Pitney Bowes Mapinfo (a company that provides software and services to help business executives make location-based decisions, such as site selection) mailed executives one-half of a CD to drive the message that without the dimension of location, their analysis is not complete. The mail piece gave executives a Web address from which they could download a free white paper to learn more about location intelligence. Mapinfo combined the direct mail piece with banner ads on business-publication Web sites (such as BusinessWeek [<a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com">http://www.businessweek.com</a>], Forbes [<a class="link" href="http://www.forbes.com">http://www.forbes.com</a>], CNNMoney [<a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com">http://money.cnn.com</a>], and MSNMoney [<a class="link" href="http://moneycentral.msn.com">http://moneycentral.msn.com</a>]) to drive executives to the white paper. The result? Mapinfo received more than three thousand white paper downloads, of which more than 70 percent were senior management executives; more than thirteen hundred opt-ins to receive e-mail communications from MapInfo; and more than two hundred registrations for Mapinfo’s webinar.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_014">“Pitney Bowes Intelligently Plots Strategy for MapInfo,” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, August 13, 2007, 28.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s04_p03">In another example, Babcock &amp; Jenkins, a direct-marketing agency, developed an integrated campaign for Sun Microsystems. The campaign included direct mail, e-mail, telemarketing, and online marketing to drive potential new Sun customers to a Web site where they could register to win prizes in a sweepstakes. The campaign was a B2B (business-to-business) campaign in which Babcock &amp; Jenkins helped Sun deliver leads to its channel partners (namely the resellers who sell Sun systems). The campaign generated 120 percent more registrations than expected. The success was due in part to demographic profiling that identified potential customers and why they buy, and then used an integrated campaign to reinforce the messages and reach customers in different ways. “We use an approach we call connected strategy,” said Denise Barnes, president of Babcock &amp; Jenkins, “integrating direct mail, e-mail, telemarketing, banners, newsletters, print, microsites, events, podcasts, webcasts and social media into one-to-one communications for our clients.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_015">Kate Maddox, “Babcock &amp; Jenkins Focuses on Database-Driven Marketing; Runner-up Direct Agency of the Year,” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, October 9, 2006, 30.</span></p>

Today this strategy underpins many promotional tools, especially those that have an element of direct communications with the customer, such as personal sales and direct marketing. Databases contain customer names, addresses, purchase profiles, psychographic and demographic details, purchase patterns, media preferences, credit ratings, and other information that helps a company target and create the right message and offer for each customer. This data can come from sources such as internal sales data, online opt-in registrations, loyalty program data, contest forms, third-party database sellers, and public government records (e.g., home sales).</p>

For example, the retailer Brookstone uses its loyalty program to recognize customers who have purchased from its store, catalog, or Web site before (using an e-mail address, phone number, or membership number to recognize the customer). Brookstone records every sales transaction across every channel (whether at the store, online, or through a catalog) and rewards the customer with credits based on how much they have purchased from the company. Customers can apply these credits toward future purchases; this cements their relationship with the company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_016">Connie Robbins Gentry, “Personal Recognition: Multichannel Retailers Market One-On-One to Loyal Shoppers,” <em class="emphasis">Chain Store Age</em>, January 2007, 78.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s02_s04_s04_p01">For better or worse, technological advances make it easier and easier for marketers to track us and our preferences very precisely. As we saw when we discussed target marketing, one hot trend is <em class="emphasis">behavioral targeting</em>, which refers to presenting people with advertisements based on their Internet use. For example, Microsoft combines personal data from the 263 million users of its free Hotmail e-mail service—the biggest in the world—with information it gains from monitoring their searches. When you sign up for Hotmail, the service asks you for personal information including your age, occupation, and address (though you’re not required to answer). If you use Microsoft’s search engine it calls Live Search, the company keeps a record of the words you search for and the results you clicked on. Microsoft’s behavioral targeting system will allow its advertising clients to send different ads to each person surfing the Web. For instance, if a twenty-five-year-old financial analyst living in a big city is comparing prices of cars online, BMW could send her an ad for a Mini Cooper. But it could send a forty-five-year-old suburban businessman with children who is doing the same search an ad for the X5 SUV.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_017">Aaron O.

    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What, Who, Where—and How Much?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s01_p01">We have to be able to answer these four basic questions before we move forward:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s01_p02">An integrated promotional plan needs to address these four questions. To see how this works in the real world, let’s look at how Kellogg’s developed such a plan for its Special K cereal brand. First, the company set sales objectives, which included targets for existing products as well as for new launches. Then, Kellogg’s promotion team worked with its ad agency to define the messaging strategy. The focus was on losing weight and maintaining that weight loss by using Special K products. Then, the question was how to implement the strategy and how to allocate the client’s promotional budget to each part of the plan. The team divided the campaign into a series of initiatives timed to different seasons, and it earmarked a specific amount to spend on each initiative:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s01_l02">
            <li>The campaign started with a “Special K Challenge” to lose six pounds in two weeks. This part of the campaign drew in new customers to the brand. The campaign launched to coincide with New Year’s resolutions to lose weight.</li>
            <li>In spring, the agency launched a new campaign it called “Are You Beach Ready?” This campaign featured a beach towel and bag as a premium.</li>
            <li>The third campaign in the series began in the fall, this time with a “Drop a Jean Size!” theme, giving customers a free pair of jeans in an instant-win sweepstakes when their weight loss goal was achieved.</li>
            <li>In winter, Special K urged consumers to lose the pounds with a free-in-mail personal training DVD.</li>
            <li>Throughout the year, coupons were put onto Special K packages. The coupons boosted multiple purchases. Print ads in publications targeting women (fashion and parenting magazines) and TV commercials during programs with high female viewership supported ongoing brand awareness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s01_p03">The integrated campaign worked well: Special K saw growth across all of its product lines, with double-digit growth for the brand for the year. Special K exceeded its targets for existing products as well as new products. “Integration is the key to consumer engagement,” said Marta Cyhan, Kellogg’s VP-worldwide promotions. “The goal of promotion is to build the brand while motivating consumer interaction.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn09_020">Kathleen M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s02_p01">Now that we’ve looked at all the elements in turn, let’s put it all together to see the execution of an integrated marketing campaign. We’ll use the example of the California Raisin Marketing Board (CRMB), whose goal is to promote California raisins.</p>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Set the Objectives</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s02_s01_p01">The first step was to set the objectives for the campaign. The target audience was women with children at home. The CRMB began with research, which showed that moms—and adults in general—were aware of health-related issues but felt they were too busy to always eat healthy foods. The CRMB could capitalize on this opportunity to promote raisins as a healthy, easy snack for moms and kids alike. With this objective in mind, the CRMB set three specific goals for the campaign:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>To create a personality for raisins that would appeal to the target audience</li>
                <li>To generate excitement among trade partners (food service operators, manufacturers, supermarkets) to offer raisins and raisin-based products</li>
                <li>To raise awareness and demand for raisins among the target audience</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s02_s01_p02">The CRMB hired ad agency MeringCarson to design an ad campaign. MeringCarson developed different concepts and then tested these concepts through focus group research. The research revealed that the most effective campaign was one that spoke to the target audience as women, not just mothers. “One campaign in particular featuring serene images of women consuming raisins as a part of their daily lives struck a responsive chord,” said Greg Carson, partner and Creative Director of MeringCarson. “Consumers loved the use of peaceful colors and imagery and the messages of health and empowerment embodied in the ads.”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Integrated Campaigns for Small Businesses</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s03_p01">How does a small business, say one that has less than six figures to spend on an ad campaign, advertise successfully against competitors with $20 million to spend annually? The point is not how much you spend, but how well you spend it on a set of well-coordinated marketing communications.</p>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Pool Resources with Associations and Loyal Customers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s03_s01_p01">One way to extend the reach of a small budget is to pool resources through a trade association. For example, small whiskey distilleries pool their ad money through the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Similarly, the California Raisin Board is an association of raisin growers throughout California; we’ve already seen how effective this group is. Using word of mouth is another key strategy: loyal customers become de facto brand ambassadors who spread the word to others. Third, develop Web initiatives that allow people to interact with the brand. Small companies rely on creative ideas to generate curiosity and conversation that will draw free publicity.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s03_s02_p01">Another low-budget option is to sponsor local or niche events. Red Bull energy drink drove its growth by sponsoring niche extreme sports that traditional big-budget corporate sponsors ignored. Finally, companies that make products can consider conducting local tours of their factories or facilities as a way to introduce new customers to their products, become a tourist destination, and build publicity around that.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s03_s03_s02_p02">A strategy requires several pieces: First, set objectives for the promotion—and be sure to specify measurable changes you hope to achieve so you can determine how successful your strategy is. Second, set a budget (be realistic). Third, devise a messaging strategy where you decide what you want to say and to whom. Finally, identify your promotional mix, being sure it fits the target customer you’ve decided you want to reach (don’t just pick the media you’re used to, or the ones that are “sexy,” if these aren’t the best fit to your customer). Even small businesses can implement an IMC strategy, but they have to be more creative when they harness local communications platforms to tell their story.</p>

            <li>You may not be a NASCAR fan, but this fast-paced sport is hoping to catch your attention in the days ahead. NASCAR is an aggressive marketing and promotion organization (see <a class="link" href="http://www.nascar.com">http://www.nascar.com</a>) with an ever-expanding fan base. This expanding fan base is changing the face of NASCAR and its races. Some say that a NASCAR event today is like going to a “celebrity night out.” Most NASCAR purists, on the other hand, believe that NASCAR is all about cars, cars, and more cars. After seven years of research and design experimentation, NASCAR has unveiled its “Car of Tomorrow” and believes that this speedy but safer car will help advance the popularity of NASCAR even more in the next decade. Considering how NASCAR must appeal to loyal fans and find new ones, design an integrated marketing communication (IMC) promotional plan that would help to spread NASCAR’s message about its new car to its markets. Be sure to specify the various elements of the promotional mix that you would recommend to NASCAR. Do research on NASCAR and its rise in the sports world before designing your IMC plan.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Integrated marketing communications (IMC) help advertisers attack communication problems from a variety of points of view. This multimedia approach has been applied to communication by many advertising agencies over the past few years. One challenge for IMC planners, however, is the U.S. Hispanic market. Broadly defined, the Hispanic market includes those of Spanish, South American, Mexican, and Caribbean descent. As the number one minority in the United States, Hispanics comprise a market that is diverse with respect to preferences and lifestyles. Many in this market still speak Spanish (or native country dialect) as their primary language.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s04_p02">Investigate the Hispanic market by going to <a class="link" href="http://www.demographics.com">http://www.demographics.com</a> or a favorite search engine. After you have reviewed marketing and advertising efforts toward this target market, propose an IMC promotional mix that you believe would be ideal for carrying a shopping mall’s message to Hispanics. The basic message would be “Come to the Mall—We’re Here to Serve Your Needs.” The shopping mall believes that as they attract Hispanics, sales and profits will increase. Discuss your promotional mix plan with peers.</p>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s04_p03">When you think of Hershey’s, you think of chocolate, right? You might be surprised to know that industry professionals see Hershey’s as a marketing and advertising machine. This is somewhat surprising, given that Hershey’s shunned advertising of any kind for years. Today, however, Hershey’s has embraced a multifaceted approach to its communications, marketing, and advertising. One of these facets is its interactive Web site (see <a class="link" href="http://www.hersheys.com">http://www.hersheys.com</a>). After reviewing the basic structure of the Hershey’s Web site, click on the “promotions” button on the opening page. Once you have done this, you will see all the current Hershey’s promotions. Review each of these promotions. Take each highlighted promotion and describe what you believe to be: (a) the primary market for the promotion, (b) the promotional mix tools that would be most useful to the promotion, and (c) an assessment of Hershey’s chances of success for the promotion. Discuss your findings with peers.</p>

            <li>Assume that you are a proponent of using integrated marketing communications to solve communications problems. Prepare a short two-page paper that could be used to support your position. Next, looking at an integrated media approach from the perspective of someone who advocates a traditional mass media approach for solving communication problems, attack the ideas you just formulated. Summarize the arguments against integrated campaigns. Discuss your findings with peers.</li>
            <li>Assume that you have just been given a $10 million budget to spend on sales promotional tools. The purpose of your budget is to convince consumers to begin to use reusable grocery bags when shopping for food. This environmental initiative is favored by most grocery chains. The bags (if purchased) would be sold for one dollar at grocery stores. Outline your plan for changing consumer preferences in this area. Be sure to consider all of the sales promotional alternatives as you formulate your plan. Designate how much money should be spent for your designated tools. Share your ideas with peers.</li>
            <li>Guerrilla marketing is becoming more popular as costs of promotions continue to increase. Public relations (PR) specialists have learned to use this unique form of marketing because of its low cost and highly creative nature. Your task is to design a guerrilla marketing effort that will introduce a new flavored bottled water to the Asian market in San Francisco. Initial distributors would be convenience stores, street vendors, and neighborhood vending machines. Be specific in what you would plan to do and how much you think it might cost. Share your plan with peers.</li>
            <li>Many universities and colleges have turned to database marketing to help target student populations. Describe how your university could use database marketing to reach potential freshmen students. Be sure to indicate how these students would be found and eventually reached by the university’s or college’s efforts.</li>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch09_s04_p04">The Direct Marketing Association (DMA) is an advocacy organization whose intent is to encourage the ethical use of direct marketing to solve advertising and communication problems. The association’s task is not easy, given the ethical tension between members of the industry and consumer advocacy groups. Many of the complaints about invasion of privacy, high pressure tactics, and false information are directed against the direct marketing industry. Visit the DMA Web site at <a class="link" href="http://www.the-dma.org">http://www.the-dma.org</a>. Examine how the DMA addresses ethics complaints and advocates for the industry. What ethical issues do you think were adequately addressed by the DMA? What ethical issues do you think still need to be resolved? How would you rate the organization’s effectiveness based on what you have seen and read? Discuss your findings with your peers.</p>
