    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_p01">Advertising is “sexy,” no doubt. Especially in the “golden years” of the ad biz in the 1960s, as the hit TV series <em class="emphasis">Mad Men</em> depicts, it seems like the executives smoke and drink their way through the day while the poor souls in manufacturing or accounting do the heavy lifting. Anyone who actually works in advertising will readily tell you that the halo of glamour is a myth—but nonetheless that’s the stereotype many people (including some advertising and marketing majors) hold.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_p02">The reality is that advertising is hard work—and it’s an essential part of doing business. It’s also expensive. There’s no question (at least in our minds) that advertising returns considerable value to the client. But how do you prove that to the bean counters? Unlike most other areas of business, alas, it’s not always so easy to assess the value of advertising and marketing activities. How does the “warm and fuzzy” feeling an ad creates translate into cold hard cash on the bottom line?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_p03">As competition for sales, eyeballs, souls, or whatever unit is in play continues to escalate in virtually every category (both profit and nonprofit), advertisers are under pressure as never before to justify their existence. This challenge is compounded by the way a firm traditionally states its objectives: a marketing strategy typically uses vague goals like “increase awareness of our product” or “encourage people to eat healthier snacks.” These objectives are important, but their lack of specificity makes it virtually impossible for senior management to determine marketing’s true impact.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Return on Investment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s01_p01">Because management may view these efforts as <em class="emphasis">costs</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">investments</em>, advertising is often the first item to be cut out of a firm’s budget when money is tight (like today). To win continued support for what they do (and sometimes to keep their jobs), advertisers are scrambling to prove to management that they generate measurable value by aligning what their work achieves with the firm’s overall business objectives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_001">Jeff Lowe, <em class="emphasis">“The Marketing Dashboard: Measuring Marketing Effectiveness,”</em><em class="emphasis"> Venture Communications</em>, February 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.brandchannel.com/images/papers/dashboard.pdf">http://www.brandchannel.com/images/papers/dashboard.pdf</a> (accessed February 9, 2009); G.

And they’re not just asking for proof that advertising moves products—increasingly they demand to see a link between tactical actions, such as specific promotions, on a firm’s market share and even on a firm’s overall financial value (as measured by market capitalization).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_002">Cf. Roland T. Rust, Tim Ambler, Gregory S. Carpenter, V. Kumar, &amp; Rajendra K. Srivastava, “Measuring Marketing Productivity: Current Knowledge and Future Directions,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing</em> 68 (October 2004): 76–89.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s01_p03">This is no small task for advertisers, whose goals are often intangible and whose results may not be readily apparent in the next quarter. Another problem they face is the skepticism of many who hold the purse strings in companies; executives in other parts of the business may believe (rightly or wrongly) that a marketer never met a budget item she didn’t want. According to one study, six in ten financial executives believe their companies’ marketing departments have an inadequate understanding of financial controls, and seven in ten said their companies don’t use marketing inputs and forecasts in financial guidance to Wall Street or in public disclosures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s01_p04">Marketers echo this pessimism; many acknowledge they have some distance to go before they understand (and quantify) the impact of what they do. In the same study, only one in ten marketer respondents said they could forecast the effect of a 10 percent cut in spending. Just 14 percent of marketing executives said senior management in their companies had confidence in their firms’ marketing forecasts. One of the analysts who conducted the study commented, “The thing that scared me most is that marketers don’t believe their numbers either.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_003">Quoted in Bradley Johnson, “Survey Finds CFOs Skeptical of Their Own Firms’ ROI Claims: ANA Confronts Lack of Confidence at Marketing Accountability Conference,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 15, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=129629">http://adage.com/article?article_id=129629</a> (accessed July 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s01_p05">The difficulties in quantifying marketing’s contribution to the bottom line—and the growing pressure from CEOs to do so—helps to explain why a recent <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em> survey of the shelf life of top-level functional executives revealed that the average job tenure of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chief marketing officer (CMO)</a><span class="glossdef">A company’s key executive responsible for achieving goals in all market segments.</span></span> is the lowest among the areas—26 months, compared with 44 months for CEOs, 39 months for chief financial officers (CFOs), and 36 months for chief information officers (CIOs). The pressure to provide tangible results is intense.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_004">Ian Ayers, <em class="emphasis">Super Crunchers: Why Thinking-by-Numbers Is the New Way To Be Smart</em> (New York: Bantam, 2007); Jerry Adler, “Era of the Super Cruncher,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, September 3, 2007, 42; “The Short Life of the Chief Marketing Officer,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, December 10, 2007, 63–65.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s01_p06">So when a company looks to shave costs to improve its return to stockholders, advertising is a particularly easy target for cost cutting because few companies have developed reliable ways to track or predict the ROI for such spending. Lacking such measures, management often computes an advertising budget strictly as a percentage of revenues, or they base it on the previous year’s budget. As any fan of advertising’s impact (those who remain) can attest, this logic is seriously flawed: if revenues are falling, it may be because you’re not advertising enough! The last thing you want to do is reduce your investment to inform the market about your product or service.</p>

    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Metrics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s02_p01">How can advertisers make that case credibly? As we’ll see, it depends on the type of advertising they do and how they measure its results. Typical metrics for traditional advertising (i.e., magazine ads, TV, etc.) include these:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Advertising awareness</em>: How many people saw your ad and recognized the brand?</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Trial</em>: Did more people try the product after they saw your ads?</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Qualitative evidence</em>: Working mothers in four focus groups absolutely loved the ads.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para"><em class="emphasis">Sales volume</em>: Did sales increase from the time period before the ad campaign to the time period after it? Warning: While it’s tempting to conclude that this is the only metric you need, this measure can be deceiving. You need to consider other factors:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s02_l02">
                    <li>What else was going on in the external environment that might have influenced this activity? The best ad campaign ever devised probably couldn’t move a lot of gas-guzzling Hummers today.</li>
                    <li>How much did you have to spend to get the results? You could sell a record number of Hummers (even today) if you priced them at $49.99—but do you want to?</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s02_p02">A single best all-around ROI formula is the Holy Grail today, but in reality companies vary widely in the way they tackle this issue (the notable thing is that many are tackling it at all). Some rely on sophisticated statistical analyses while others are content to track general changes in sales trends or brand awareness. General Mills decides how much to invest in marketing and advertising by examining the historical performance of the brand as well as market research metrics on previous advertising effectiveness, growth versus competition, and other changes in the marketplace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s02_p03">Another approach is to use the statistical technique called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">regression analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Statistical technique that identifies the amount of an effect we can attribute to each of several variables operating simultaneously.</span></span>, which identifies the amount of an effect we can attribute to each of several variables that operate simultaneously. One analyst calculates the percent of total sales attributable just to a brand’s existing sales momentum and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand equity</a><span class="glossdef">The value of a brand name over and above the value of a generic product in the same category.</span></span> (the value of a brand name over and above the value of a generic product in the same category). He determines brand equity by identifying the financial value the brand contributes compared to product value, distribution, pricing, services, and other factors. He calculates the short-term incremental impact of advertising on sales by looking at several years of sales data and creating a sales trend line. Waving his statistical magic wand, he then looks at whether a specific promotion results in incremental sales, or sales over what would we expect based on normal conditions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s01_s02_p04">Indeed, consulting firms such as Corporate Branding LLC and Interbrand, as well as a few big ad agencies like Young &amp; Rubicam (Y&amp;R), develop their own proprietary methods to arrive at a brand’s financial value. They track these values over time to help clients see whether their investments are paying off. Y&amp;R’s Brand Asset Valuator is based on field research of consumers on thousands of brands. When the agency studied just what builds brand equity, it identified one crucial element: does the consumer believe the product is different in a relevant way—does the message offer a clear, memorable reason to buy the product, also known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unique selling proposition (USP)</a><span class="glossdef">A clear, memorable reason to buy the product.</span></span>? Y&amp;R tracks how well various advertising campaigns differentiate brands and the degree to which they increase brand value as a result.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_005">Kris Frieswick, “New Brand Day: Attempts to Gauge the ROI of Advertising Hinge on Determining a Brand’s Overall Value,” <em class="emphasis">CFO.com</em>, November 1, 2001, <a class="link" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3001802/1/c_3046511">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3001802/1/c_3046511</a> (accessed August 15, 2008).</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_p01">Traditional (broadcast) media struggle to demonstrate a direct impact on the bottom line. These advertising messages reach many consumers at the same time, and these receivers also get bombarded by a multitude of competing ads and other stimuli that vie for their attention. It’s not easy to connect the dots between a single commercial (or even an entire ad campaign) and the purchases of thousands of people who may or may not have noticed the message in the first place.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_p02">As we’ve seen, it’s fairly easy for media planners to compute a metric that lets them compare the relative <em class="emphasis">cost-effectiveness</em> of different media and of spots run on different vehicles in the same medium.

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_p03">Unfortunately, CPM alone is not a great indicator of ROI: it tells us how good we are at getting our message <em class="emphasis">to</em> an audience but nothing about the impact that message has when it reaches the target. Let’s briefly review some of the other ways advertisers try to provide evidence that the messages they create actually generate value for the client and its stockholders.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Network TV</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p01">For some time now network television has been in a defensive posture as the industry struggles to justify its existence. Some skeptics predict the demise of this medium as an advertising platform because our society is too fragmented for it to be effective. Note: this criticism certainly doesn’t apply to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">direct-response TV (DRTV)</a><span class="glossdef">TV advertising in which sales are directly linked to on-air programming, as in shopping channels or “call now” ads.</span></span>, where sales are directly linked to on-air programming or “call now” ads. When a shopping channel like QVC puts that unique cubic zirconium ring on the air, the network knows within minutes whether it’s a winner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p02">While an advertiser in the 1960s could be confident that he could reach a hefty proportion of the American public with a commercial on one of the three networks in existence at the time, today the (TV) picture is much different. Consumers can choose from hundreds of channels—when they’re not surfing the Web or listening to podcasts and MP3 files. Young people in particular are migrating away from TV and spending more time online—especially as programming that used to appear exclusively on TV becomes available as streaming video. To rub salt into the wound, viewers today can exercise control over what they see as they gleefully TiVo or DVR their way into commercial-free entertainment on their big flat-screen TVs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p03">For now, estimates vary widely—one study found that the average ROI of TV advertising is 0.54 to 1 for packaged goods and 0.87 to 1 for nonpackaged goods. According to this research, these media on average actually <em class="emphasis">lose</em> money for the advertiser!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_006">Bill Harvey, “ARF Engagement Recipe: Surprise, Utility and Emotion,” <em class="emphasis">Next Century Media</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.nextcenturymedia.com/2006/03/arf-engagement-recipe-surprise-utility.htm">http://www.nextcenturymedia.com/2006/03/arf-engagement-recipe- surprise-utility.htm</a>, March 3, 2006 (accessed August 16, 2008).</span> Another estimate, by well-known media analyst Kevin Clancy, is a bit more sunny: he states that the average ROI of TV advertising campaigns ranges from 1 to 4 percent—still a small number, but at least it’s in the positive column.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_007">“How to Improve Marketing ROI: Free Kevin Clancy Web Seminar Offers Five Ways to Improve Marketing Performance,” <em class="emphasis">The Copernicus MZine</em>, November 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.copernicusmarketing.com/about/mzine/monthlyeds/nov03.shtml">http://www.copernicusmarketing.com/about/mzine/monthlyeds/nov03.shtml</a> (accessed August 16, 2008); <a class="link" href="http://www.copernicusmarketing.com/about/mzine/monthlyeds/nov03.shtml">http://www.copernicusmarketing.com/about/mzine/monthlyeds/nov03.shtml</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p04">Traditionally the metric this industry uses is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">viewership ratings</a><span class="glossdef">Data indicating how many people watch certain TV shows; particularly data Nielsen compiles.</span></span>, particularly those Nielsen compiles. Again, these data have questionable relevance to ROI because they only show whether people watch the shows and not necessarily whether they use the commercial breaks to hit the bathroom or make a sandwich.

There is widespread consensus among advertisers that the TV industry will need new audience metrics—other than reach and frequency information it uses to calculate CPM—to report commercial ratings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p05">To get a sense of the pessimism surrounding this industry, consider some results from a recent study by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) and Forrester Research:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Almost 70 percent of advertisers think that DVRs and video-on-demand will reduce or destroy the effectiveness of traditional thirty-second commercials.</li>
            <li>When DVRs spread to thirty million homes, close to 60 percent of advertisers report they will spend less on conventional TV advertising; of those, 24 percent will cut their TV budgets by at least 25 percent.</li>
            <li>Eighty percent of advertisers plan to spend more of their advertising budget on Web advertising and 68 percent of advertisers will consider (Web-based) search engine marketing.</li>
            <li>Advertisers are also looking at alternatives to traditional TV advertising, and almost half plan to spend more of their advertising budgets on emerging platforms (which we’ll address later) such as TV program sponsorships, online video ads, and product placement.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_008">ANA / Forrester, “Beyond the 30 Second Spot: Marketers Adding Alternatives to Television Advertising,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Today</em>, March 22, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.marketingtoday.com/research/0306/tv_advertising_less_effective.htm">http://www.marketingtoday.com/research/0306/tv_advertising_less_effective.htm</a> (accessed February 9, 2009).</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p06">With all that negativity, is network television dead? Don’t write its obituary yet. Although it’s undeniable that our world is a lot more fragmented than it used to be, there still are large-scale events that unite us and continue to command a huge mass television audience. These include the <em class="emphasis">Super Bowl</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Olympics</em> (with an estimated four billion viewers) and, of course, <em class="emphasis">American Idol</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p07">Advertisers also are getting more creative as they search for ways to draw in audiences—and entice them to stay for the commercials. For example, some are experimenting with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bitcoms</a><span class="glossdef">A set of ads inserted within a TV show, often introduced by a stand-up comedian (perhaps an actor in the show itself) performing a small set that leads into the actual ads.</span></span> that try to boost viewers’ retention of a set of ads inserted within a TV show (we call this a <em class="emphasis">commercial pod</em>).

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p08">Finally, the networks are taking baby steps toward getting more credit for viewership that occurs in places other than people’s living rooms. Our mobile society exposes us to television programming in bars, stores, hospital waiting areas, and dorm rooms—current ratings systems don’t reflect this. In early 2008 Nielsen fielded a new service it calls <em class="emphasis">The Nielsen Out-of-Home Report</em>; this is a cell-phone based service that provides metrics for television viewing that occurs outside of the home in bars, hotels, airports, and other locations. CNN has already started to use this service. In addition, the <em class="emphasis">Nielsen Online VideoCensus</em> will measure the amount of television and other video programming people view over the Internet.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_010">Anthony Crupi, “CNN Orders Out-of-Home Study on TV Viewership,” <em class="emphasis">Mediaweek</em>, August 11, 2008 (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p10">Cable television has prospered at networks’ expense because it is much more targeted—and a lot cheaper. Travel, cooking, science, history, weight loss: it’s all available to a well-defined audience that’s self-selected to be interested in ads that relate to these categories. Still, like its older brother, network TV, cable lacks precise metrics. In some cases an advertiser will take advantage of cable’s targeting capabilities to conduct an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">A-B test</a><span class="glossdef">Metric obtained by showing one execution of a commercial to a select group of viewers in one part of a city and a different version to another group elsewhere, then examining the product’s sales in each area.</span></span> of a commercial. This means that it will show one execution to a select group of viewers who live in one part of a city and a different version to another group—and then examine the product’s sales in each region to identify any results. But this is still an indirect metric and is not routinely used.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s01_p11">MTV Networks—one of the biggest cable success stories—is trying to remedy that problem now. The network has contracted with a firm called Marketing Evolution to develop a system for its advertisers based on meeting benchmarks including awareness, relevancy, new purchase intent, purchase loyalty, and advocacy. Advertisers may still pay on a CPM basis, but also have the option to contract with Marketing Evolution to measure the success of their buys.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_011">Steve Miller, “MTV Networks Puts New Advertising ROI Metrics into Rotation,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, June 29, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.brandweek.com/bw/content_display/news-and-features/direct/e3i3a6a726c3dd89a140cfb16d45053c8ec">http://www.brandweek.com/bw/content_display/news-and-features/direct/e3i3a6a726c3dd89a140cfb16d45053c8ec</a> (accessed August 15, 2008).</span> Time will tell if this new project will rock the metrics world.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s02_p01">Radio stations design their programming to attract certain listeners and then sell those listeners to advertisers in tiny increments. As with TV, advertisers look carefully at listener ratings to determine who and how many listeners their ad will reach on a given station—the leading industry ratings are provided by Arbitron. The company used to collect these data by asking listeners to keep a diary of the stations they listen to, but now it uses a Portable People Meter to automate the process and deliver more reliable results.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_012"><a class="link" href="http://www.arbitron.com/downloads/arbitron2008mediaplan.pdf">http://www.arbitron.com/downloads/arbitron2008mediaplan.pdf</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s02_p02">A radio station has an ad time inventory of about eighteen minutes per hour, which it sells in increments of fifteen seconds, thirty seconds, and sixty seconds (:15s, :30s, and :60s). But not all minutes are valued equally. Audience size shifts dramatically throughout the day, and radio rates vary to reflect the change in the estimated number of listeners your ad will reach.</p>

For example, a Pepsi Jazz two-page spread with a three-dimensional pop-up of the opened bottle and a small audio chip that played jazz music from the bottle’s opening as well as a scratch-and-sniff tab that let readers smell its black cherry vanilla flavor scored an amazing 100 percent in reader recall.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_016">Erik Sass, “Study Finds Spectacular Print Ads Get Spectacular Recall,” <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com">http://www.mediapost.com</a> (accessed February 23, 2007).</span></p>

            <li>Double-page spreads and bound multiple page inserts have significantly greater impact than full-page ads. Readers also are more likely to remember the brand name associated with the ad and to actually read the copy.</li>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s02_s03_p05">Traditional broadcast media platforms are under great pressure to demonstrate that they contribute to a client’s bottom line. Unfortunately, there’s no consensus regarding the single best way to do this—especially because these messages often intend to shape opinions or slowly evolve or reinforce a brand’s image over time rather than motivating an immediate purchase. For now, most metrics estimate the number and characteristics of consumers who get exposed to the message, while in some cases focus group or survey data based upon a sample of these people can suggest that these messages are likely to result in the desired action. Media companies in the television, radio, magazine, and newspaper industries continue to work on innovations that will allow them to show more direct results to advertisers who need to decide where to place their dollars.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_p01">It’s no secret that traditional advertising venues no longer provide the punch they used to. Advertising clutter makes it more difficult to get noticed in a crowded media environment, and even if people see or hear your ad, they are so busy multitasking that they may not react to it as you’d like. For this reason many advertisers look to alternative media either to replace or, more likely, to supplement their broadcast efforts. These options can be especially powerful for the client who needs short-term results (<em class="emphasis">buy something now</em>) rather than a longer-term brand building effort.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Point-of-Purchase</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p01">As the effectiveness of traditional media platforms continues to come under scrutiny, a lot of companies are allocating a greater proportion of their advertising dollars to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">point-of-purchase advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Also called <em class="emphasis">marketing-at-retail</em>. Can be an elaborate product display or demonstration, a coupon-dispensing machine, or even someone giving out free samples of a new cookie in the grocery aisle.</span></span> (POP, also called <em class="emphasis">marketing-at-retail</em>). U.S. companies spend more than $13 billion each year in this category. A POP can be an elaborate product display or demonstration, a coupon-dispensing machine, or even someone giving out free samples of a new cookie in the grocery aisle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p02">Coupons and other short-term sales promotions (e.g., “buy one, get one free”) are forms of POP that are extremely trackable—it’s fairly easy to monitor redemption rates to the <em class="emphasis">n</em>th degree so an advertiser knows exactly which offers resulted in purchases. The eventual impact on the bottom line? Not always so obvious—a rush of purchases in the short-term to take advantage of a big price reduction ironically might decrease the brand’s long-term value if these cuts cheapen its image! And you thought this was going to be easy.…</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p03">As we all know, the experiences we have in a retail environment exert a big impact on the likelihood we’ll purchase—though, again, these can be hard to quantify. However, POP industry experts claim that a well-designed in-store display can boost impulse purchases by as much as 10 percent. One study that compared short-term sales increases among a number of different media across three hundred campaigns reported that in-store fixtures yield an average of 160 percent, and in-store posters delivered a 136 percent return.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_018">“In-Store Marketing Gives Highest Return,” November 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.popai.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;section=June&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=897">http://www.popai.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;section=June&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=897</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p04">Due to the high stakes involved, several initiatives are under way to employ high-tech methods that more precisely measure just what happens in the store when consumers encounter advertising messages. The industry trade association POPAI (Point-of-Purchase Advertising Institute) is spearheading a major initiative with the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) to establish measurement standards for the industry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_019">“The Association of National Advertisers and POPAI Lead Global Marketing at-Retail Initiative (MARI),” <a class="link" href="http://www.popai.com">http://www.popai.com</a>, October 7, 2005 (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p05">In addition, an alliance of major marketers including Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, 3M, Kellogg, Miller Brewing, and Wal-Mart is using infrared sensors to measure the reach of in-store marketing efforts. Retailers have long counted the number of shoppers who enter and exit their stores, and they use product barcode data to track what shoppers buy. But big consumer-products companies also need to know how many people actually walk by their promotional displays so they can evaluate how effective these are. Although it’s possible to fool these sensors (they still can’t tell if someone is simply cutting through to reach the other end of the store), this sophisticated measurement system is a valuable first step that many advertisers eagerly await.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_020">Ellen Byron and Suzanne Vranica, “Scanners Check Out Who’s Browsing Marketers, Retailers Test Sensors to Weigh Reach of In-Store Promotions,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, September 27, 2006, B2.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s01_p06">Finally, the marketing research company TNS is about to launch a new system to measure POP in grocery stores. The <em class="emphasis">TNS Insight Dashboard</em> will be a syndicated service that provides a report each quarter on the effectiveness of in-store marketing strategies. The Dashboard monitors where shoppers are in a grocery store at any given time, tracks the number of seconds they spend at any display and the amount of time they spend with other products, and then overlays these results with sales information so TNS can determine which displays actually lead to purchases. As a TNS executive observed, “A display’s stopping power is a good thing when it generates a lot of purchasing, but if people are spending many seconds there and not buying, something isn’t speaking to customers properly.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_021">Quoted in Sarah Mahoney, “TNS Unveils New In-Store Metrics For Grocers,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Daily</em>, July 14, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediapost.com">http://www.mediapost.com</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s02_p01">Surprise—there is no standard metric for traditional billboard advertising. However, common sense suggests that these messages are more useful in some contexts than in others. Because passing motorists only see a billboard for a few seconds, this medium is more effective to convey a quick visual message than substantial information. Billboard messages need to be kept to five or six words at the most. In this case a picture truly is worth a thousand words. Again, it’s awfully hard to quantify the impact a vivid picture can make, though this could be substantial if it’s sufficiently interesting and differentiates the product (especially when people see it repeatedly).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s02_p02">Outdoor advertising is quickly moving to more sophisticated digital technology that people can see at a greater distance and that can present more detailed verbal information. In research conducted by OTX, a global consumer research and consulting firm, 63 percent of adults said that advertising on digital signage “catches their attention.” Respondents consider advertising in this media to be more unique and entertaining and less annoying than both traditional and online media. The study also reports that awareness of digital out-of-home media is high—62 percent of adults have seen digital signage in the past twelve months—and is at levels comparable to billboards, magazines, and newspapers. On average, people notice digital signage in six different kinds of locations during their week, giving advertisers the opportunity to intercept people with their brand message at various touchpoints during their weekly routines as they work, play, and socialize. It’s even more effective at reaching eighteen- to thirty-four-year-olds, who rate this medium higher than the general population.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_022">“Report: Digital Signage More Effective than Traditional Media,” October 24, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/article.php?id=18696&amp;prc=407&amp;page=190">http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/article.php?id=18696&amp;prc=407&amp;page=190</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s03_p01">In 2008 advertisers spent $3.6 billion to place their products in TV shows and movies. Until fairly recently, product placement was a casual operation where prop masters made informal arrangements to procure products they needed to dress a set. Today, it’s big business—but the effectiveness of these placements is anyone’s guess.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s03_p02">Nielsen, the company that compiles TV program viewership ratings, is working on a process with another company, IAG, to quantify when products appear in shows. IAG currently produces product placement ratings that are based on viewer recall; it asks 2.5 million people to respond to surveys online after they watch their favorite shows. These ask whether viewers remember the brand, think more positively about it, or want to purchase it, and whether the placement disrupted their viewing experience. Another firm called ITVX uses a system that measures up to sixty variables to determine a placement’s effectiveness, including whether a product appears in the foreground or background, whether a viewer is aware that a brand is on screen, and whether the show’s commercials are coordinated with the product placements.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_024">Alana Semuels, “Research Firm Nielsen Tallying Product Placement Ads,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, July 21, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.latimes.com">http://www.latimes.com</a> (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

Advertisers want more access to viewers like you as online video advertising comes into its own. Some companies including CBS and Electronic Arts have reversed their positions about prosecuting users who post unauthorized clips of their content and have instead started to sell advertising on these spots. Interestingly, CBS is doing this even though its sister company Viacom is involved in a billion-dollar copyright lawsuit against Google, which owns YouTube.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_025">Brian Stelter, “Some Media Companies Choose to Profit from Pirated YouTube Clips,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, August 15, 2008 (accessed August 16, 2008).</span></p>

Many advertisers are intrigued by the possibilities they see here, especially since the elements within an online game can be changed over time. Videogames also can show digital video ads before play, during breaks in a game, or following completion of the game. A client can introduce its products directly into the game in the form of beverages, mobile phones, cars, and so on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s05_p02">The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) is at work to define standard metrics for this new medium. The videogame platform shares some characteristics of online ads because when people play online, clients can track which specific elements in a game yield a response (e.g., when a player clicks on a sponsored link). The IAB has identified basic metrics that include:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s05_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per thousand (CPM)</em>—Advertising inventory is sold on the basis of “number of impressions delivered.” But just what constitutes an “impression” has yet to be agreed upon. For example, it may be defined as ten seconds of cumulative exposure to an ad format or element within a game session. In order for each one second to be counted, the scene the gamer sees must meet defined parameters for the angle of view to the ad in addition to the size of the ad unit on the screen. Other measurement methods count “interactive impressions” once there is an interaction between the gamer and the interactive ad unit.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per click (CPC)</em>—A media company or search provider is paid only when the user or visitor clicks on an ad.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per action (CPA)</em>—Performance ad networks often use this model where the revenue event is triggered only when the user or visitor takes the desired action with the advertiser (i.e., makes a purchase).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost per view (CPV)</em>—This relatively new model triggers the revenue event only when the user or visitor opts in to view the ad, often by clicking on a prompt or “bug.”</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p01">Public relations campaigns traditionally measure impact in terms of the extent to which the client obtains media coverage. A basic metric is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">media impressions</a><span class="glossdef">An estimate of the number of people who see an ad in a magazine, a newspaper, or on a talk show or who hear about it in a radio interview.</span></span>; as you learned in earlier chapters, this is an estimate of the number of people who see the plug in a magazine or newspaper or on a talk show or who hear about it in a radio interview. A PR firm typically delivers a comprehensive list of media citations to the client, and it may rank these in terms of the prestige or circulation of the outlet or how prominent the mention was in this outlet. Again, this metric doesn’t really speak to any impact the citations have on actual purchases or attitude change.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_032">Deborah Holloway, “How to Select a Measurement System That’s Right for You,” <em class="emphasis">Public Relations Quarterly</em> (Fall 1992): 15–17.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p02">As WOM (word-of-mouth) assumes a greater role in many advertisers’ strategies—especially online buzz—the pressure is on for agencies to demonstrate that this approach does more than just make people talk about a brand. In fact, one prominent WOM agency called BzzAgent recently took a bold step to back up its claims that its buzz campaigns yield attractive ROI. With its “WOM Impact Guarantee” program the agency invites any brand marketer and its agency partners to take part in a challenge in which BzzAgent and the agency partner will run competing campaigns. If BzzAgent does not top the competing agency by 20 percent across four metrics—brand awareness, consumer opinion, purchase intent, and actual sales—the agency will refund the marketer the cost of its word-of-mouth campaign and measurement costs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn14_033">Michael Bush, “Better ROI or Your Money Back, Says Buzz Agency,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 14, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=129593">http://adage.com/article?article_id=129593</a> (accessed July 16, 2008).</span> That’s putting your money where your (word-of-) mouth is.</p>

Contrary to the assumptions of many students who brazenly post embarrassing photos of themselves on Facebook, the Web is forever—most content that goes online can be traced and analyzed long after it’s been put there. That photo of you from last weekend’s wild party might come back to haunt you someday!</p>

The company’s processing programs then analyze vocabulary, language patterns, and phrasing to determine whether the comments are positive or negative and whether the authors are men, women, young, or old to more accurately measure buzz.

One of the goals of the marketing campaign was to unite their multiple views of what the brand stood for. It turned out that even before it launched, stakeholders felt the campaign was successful in that it gave msnbc.com a clear story. It gave them a common lens they could use to evaluate new design concepts and editorial content, while it gave msnbc.com the cachet stakeholders felt was long overdue. It successfully overcame the past ambiguity about whether the site was primarily an offshoot of NBC versus Microsoft and promised stakeholders a clearer future. The head of msnbc.com ad sales noted: “Clients have called us asking, ‘How do we do something similar?’ It’s opened up doors.”</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s03_s07_p28">Advertisers continue to search for new platforms as they compete for the attention of media-saturated consumers. Today virtually anything—from a cemetery to a rocket ship—can be used to get across a message. But these emerging venues don’t necessarily have a tradition (yet) of measuring direct impact. An exception is direct marketing; its lifeblood is about tying a message directly to a result. Whether via mail catalogs or online ads, direct marketers carefully track the effectiveness of each and every message they send. This sounds great, and it usually is—but remember, as we’ve already noted, short-term purchases may boost your bottom line this quarter but still come back to bite you in the long term if these messages don’t contribute to a more fundamental shaping of customers’ deep-seated feelings and beliefs about the product or service. And so, the search for the Holy Grail continues.</p>

                <p class="para">The famous ad line “What’s in your wallet?” might just become “Who’s in your car?” Progressive Corp. insurance now offers a device for its insured drivers that will assist in lowering the drivers’ insurance rates. The device is about the size of a box of Tic-Tacs and monitors one’s driving time, number of miles driven, and acceleration and braking patterns. The company then adjusts driver rates to reflect the presence or absence of risky driving habits. The hope is that insured drivers will adjust their risky driving habits or at least be more aware of what they are doing that is unsafe. The product and others like it are at least partially targeted toward teens and beginning drivers who are in the habit formation stage of driving. Obviously, there are those who see this form of monitoring as excessive, an invasion of privacy, and biased against those who don’t match Progressive’s “ideal driver” profile.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s04_p02">As an advertising director, what metrics would you suggest that your client Progressive use to determine the effectiveness of its future ads featuring the device? You will need to consider a target market for Progressive’s ads. Discuss your ideas in class. For more information on Progressive and its policies go to <a class="link" href="http://www.progressive.com">http://www.progressive.com</a>.</p>

                <p class="para">One of the central concepts associated with product placement in different media forms is the idea that the product appears in a natural setting and is perceived as being something other than an ad. This rationale would then assume that the viewer, reader, or Web surfer receives a different type of message than one received in a traditional advertisement. Additionally, since most product placements are not blocked by the consumer’s screening process, the advertiser has a higher chance of reaching the chosen market.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s04_p03">Do you use TiVo or some other product to block or zap ads in your favorite TV shows? Do you try to fast-forward past any ads that appear on your DVD disks? If so, you have just made the case for product placement within those shows or DVDs.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s04_p04">Your assignment is to watch several TV shows or DVDs over three to five days. Keep a diary of product placements in those shows or DVDs. Based on what you have recorded, comment on metrics that could be used to test the effectiveness of those placements. Explain your comments and choices.</p>

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s04_p05">The Point-of-Purchase Advertising Institute (POPAI) has a wealth of information about point-of-purchase (POP) advertising. One does not usually associate POP with the “wired world.” POPAI hopes that its Web viewers will learn more about POP and how it can be used in advertising. Who knows, in tomorrow’s world POP may appear in the e-commerce stores or in your personal Web spaces. Sound too strange? Data indicate that many alternative media forms are being adapted by industry and consumers to the “wired world.” Since POP is highly effective in the retail environment, you might be able to consider how useful it might be to capture the attention of the digital consumer.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s04_p06">Go to the POPAI Web site at <a class="link" href="http://www.POPAI.org">http://www.POPAI.org</a> and read the summary of one of the books available for viewing. You’ll find your book options at the bottom of the opening page of the organization’s Web site. Summarize what you have learned from the chosen e-book. Lastly, comment on what you perceive the future of POP to be.</p>

            <li>According to material presented in the chapter, traditional (broadcast) media struggle to demonstrate a direct impact on the bottom line. Explain what is meant by this phrase. Explain the relationship between cost per thousand (CPM) and return on investment (ROI).</li>
            <li>Go to Google or another search engine and find information that lists the top five television ads from last year’s Super Bowl based on either viewers or critics’ choices. Next, find information on the advertising rates for that Super Bowl. Evaluate whether the exposure justifies the cost. Explain your evaluation procedure.</li>
            <li>Go to the Out-of-Home Video Advertising Bureau (OVAB) Web site at <a class="link" href="http://www.ovab.org">http://www.ovab.org</a>.

        <h3 class="title">Ethical Dilemma</h3>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s04_p07">Do you download software, movies, or songs without considering the legality of what you are doing? Even though this practice has consequences for some, many don’t see unauthorized downloading as necessarily bad or harmful to anyone. Using Google or another search engine, research copyright, file sharing, and music downloads to learn more about the current state of the downloading practice and any penalties associated with it. A good starting place would be the United States Copyright Office’s Web site at <a class="link" href="http://www.copyright.gov">http://www.copyright.gov</a>.</p>

RealNetworks has developed a software product (see the RealPlayer product category) that allows computers to rip information from a disk in just a few moments. This information can later be transferred to other disks. At present this process is legal. Examine RealNetworks’ description of their products and services.</p>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch14_s04_p09">What future ethical dilemma do you think such products as RealPlayer might cause? As a consumer, do you think a positive or negative buzz should be started about such products? As an advertising executive, what would be your stance on accepting companies that made software of this nature as clients? Take a stance and discuss your position in class. Discuss your position with peers or have a minidebate about the issues and positions.</p>
