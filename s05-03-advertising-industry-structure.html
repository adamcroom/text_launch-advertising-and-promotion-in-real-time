This includes planning, creating, producing, and placing the ads, as well as research before the campaign and evaluation after it to assess the campaign’s effectiveness. Full-service agencies have expanded in recent years through consolidation—larger agencies buy them when they want to provide a one-stop shop for their global clients. In the process, the types of services that agencies provide has expanded to include PR, design, and event planning.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Specialized and In-House Service Agencies</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p01">Some agencies focus on one aspect of the creative process, such as creative production work or media buying. They refer to themselves as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specialized agencies</a><span class="glossdef">Agencies that focus on one aspect of the creative process, such as media or interactive.</span></span>. Some examples will include a company that specializes in media planning and buying, such as The Media Kitchen or Greater Than One. Interactive agencies like BEAM, gaming agencies such as Fuel Games, and search agencies such as 360i will partner up with other agencies to provide services for the full campaign as determined by the client or the lead agency. These agency partners all contributed to the msnbc.com campaign led by SS+K.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p02">Some companies prefer to retain control over advertising and set up <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">in-house agencies</a><span class="glossdef">Agencies set up within the corporation, typically run by an advertising director who chooses which services to buy and which to perform internally.</span></span> within the corporation. An advertising director typically runs the in-house agency; she chooses which services to buy and which to perform internally. For example, the in-house agency could retain creative services in house, create advertisements itself, and then purchase media-buying services from the outside. The inside agency may buy services from a specialized service agency or buy services à la carte from a full service agency.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p03">Why bother to form an in-house agency? The two main reasons are to save the company money and to give the company greater control over the entire process. In addition, internal employees may have a deeper understanding of the company and its customers than would an outside agency. Insiders can also coordinate the promotion better with the firm’s overall marketing program and other functions, such as ensuring that enough products are made and delivered in advance of a promotion. Target works with their in-house agency as well as with outside agencies. They do not have an outside agency of record.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p04">Agencies also clarify their specializations in terms of location; SS+K, for example, is a U.S. agency. Some agencies are considered global agencies, such as JWT, TBWA, BBDO, and others. These agencies have offices worldwide and specialize in clients whose audiences are worldwide, such as MasterCard (McCann Worldwide is the agency).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p05">There are a few holding companies that own a number of agencies to create a network of agencies that can work together in the network. Omnicom Group, WPP, Interpublic Group, MDC Partners are the biggest media holding companies.</p>

        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Agency of Record</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p01">In addition to the types of agencies, there is also the role that the agency plays in the client’s business. The most common and secure relationship is the agency of record, or lead agency. As clients may work with many different agencies for their various needs, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">agency of record</a><span class="glossdef">Agency that has the closest relationship with the marketer in terms of strategy and spending. The marketer determines their agency of record, and the majority of business and coordination is handled through them.</span></span> is the lead agency partner and usually has the majority of the client’s business. SS+K is the agency of record for msnbc.com.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s03_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Dig Deeper</h3>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p02">The traditional approach to farm out different functions may change if some big clients get their way. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Dell are but two of several major advertisers that are dissatisfied with this strategy. More specifically, they join Procter &amp; Gamble and others to call for more collaboration between the people who do the consumer research and the people who actually create the ads. In most cases, separate companies carry out communications planning and creative functions, so coordination can be difficult, and self-serving biases may color some decisions. For example, an advertising agency might be tempted to suggest a network television campaign because it would be involved in creating the ads (and billing more in the process). Instead, advertisers prefer a <em class="emphasis">media-agnostic</em> approach, where the agency picks whatever medium works best for a specific campaign. We saw earlier that SS+K strongly endorses this philosophy.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p03">P&amp;G reacted to this problem when it shifted all its ad and marketing duties for its Oral B brand to a newly created team at Publicis Groupe that will not work on any other brands. As P&amp;G’s global marketing officer explained, “We find many of our brands are working with lots of agencies who all have their own creative people, their own planners, their own account people, and it gets to be unmanageable.” Only time will tell if other advertisers follow P&amp;G’s lead.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn02_017">Suzanne Vranica, “Ad Houses Will Need to Be More Nimble: Clients are Demanding More and Better Use of Consumer Data, Web,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, January 2, 2008, B3; Suzanne Vranica, “J&amp;J Joins Critics of Agency Structure: Consumer Researchers and Creative Teams Shouldn’t Be Separate,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, May 11, 2007, B4.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Do We Get Paid?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s02_p01">Historically, an agency receives a commission or percentage of the cost of the media it buys for the client. Traditionally, mass media has paid advertising agencies a 15 percent commission on all business brought to them. The commission covers the agency’s copywriting, art direction, and account service charges. Today, this compensation model makes less sense because many advertising services no longer include a traditional media buy.</p>
        <div class="figure large editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s02_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.11</span> </p>
            <img src="section_05/5b5617a2b8e7143f7c70732fa486be61.jpg">
            <p class="para">Here is an example of how agency compensation works for a single commercial during the Super Bowl.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s02_p02">The straight 15 percent commission is still used in some cases, but some agencies charge less than 15 percent, or have sliding scales based on how much the client spends (the more money spent, the lower the percentage fee). Some agencies offer flat-fee arrangements that clients and the agency agree upon, while others charge on an hourly basis. Others will do a combination of a flat base fee plus smaller percentages per media. Interactive media currently charges the highest commission because it requires the most management time from agency personnel.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch02_s03_s02_p03">Other innovative models include licensing fees or royalties for ideas. Some even use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">performance fees</a><span class="glossdef">A system of payment in which the agency’s fee depends on the success of the campaign.</span></span>, in which the agency’s fee depends on the success of the campaign. The client and the agency define what they mean by “success” at the start; they might measure this by looking at how well consumers recall the ads or might measure actual product sales. Agencies using performance-based models can earn much more—or much less—than the standard 15 percent commission. The rationale, however, is that the compensation would be tied to the <em class="emphasis">value</em> of the ideas. As we’ll see later, the question of just how—and whether—we should quantify the effect of advertising is one of the burning issues the industry faces.</p>
