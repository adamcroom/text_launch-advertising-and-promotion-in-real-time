    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_p01">Advertising is part of the glue that holds our culture together. It allows us to share a common experience in a landscape populated (for better or worse) by brands, images, logos, and even silly jingles. We define who we are by what we buy and wear because we know that others judge us by what we buy and wear. And advertising influences those judgments. “We understand each other not by sharing religion, politics, or ideas. We share branded things. We speak the Esperanto of advertising, <em class="emphasis">luxe populi</em>,” says advertising professor and commercial culture observer James Twitchell.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_001">James Twitchell, <em class="emphasis">Living It Up: Our Love Affair with Materialism</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002), xv.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_p02">Advertising is a sort of “commercialized gossip,” a collection of stories that companies tell customers about their products in order to make them distinguishable from one another. Some brands do such a good job of holding our attention that they become cultural icons in their own right—Apple, Nike, even the lowly Charmin (where would we be without Mr. Whipple?), and the Keebler Elves. And in collectively listening to the commercialized gossip and buying the associated products, consumers align themselves with the images and stories, knowing that other consumers will know those same stories.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_p03">The cultural dimension of advertising came of age in the 1920s. Agencies and publicists no longer sought merely to convey objective facts about the products—they sought to link products with a particular lifestyle, imbue them with glamour and prestige, and persuade potential consumers that purchasing an item could be, as historian Alan Brinkley describes it, “a personally fulfilling and enriching experience.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_002">Alan Brinkley, <em class="emphasis">American History: A Survey</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991), 648.</span> The images of ads sought to both resonate with and help define the lifestyles of those who bought the products.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_p04">People seek to differentiate themselves, so much so that a particular kind of advertising—called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dog whistle advertising</a><span class="glossdef">Advertising that works like an inside joke, targeting a particular group with messages only that group can hear and appreciate.</span></span>—targets a group with messages only that group can hear and appreciate. Like an inside joke, these ads reinforce a sense of belonging to the group and show that the advertised company “gets it” too. For example, Apple’s “Rip, Mix, Burn” campaign, which targeted young computer users with a message of ease-of-use of its iTunes music software, alluded to the prevailing (and illegal) practice of music sharing among that group.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_p05">In many ways—for better or for worse—modern advertising may be the most significant U.S. contribution to global culture. Sociologist Andrew Hacker calls advertising “this country’s most characteristic institution.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_003">Quoted in Stephen Fox, <em class="emphasis">The Mirror Makers: A History of American Advertising and Its Creators</em> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 1997), cover quote.</span> But, to say the least, this contribution is not without controversy. Critics claim that ads manipulate the public into wasting money on unneeded products. Some say advertising has corrupted holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving, making the season a time of materialism rather than a deeper celebration of thankfulness. There’s even a common rumor that Coca-Cola invented the modern-day Santa Claus (<a class="link" href="http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp">http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp</a>). Others just want to hide from the commercial messages that bombard them at every turn and enjoy some peace and quiet. Let’s take an objective look at advertising, warts and all.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advertising Is a Major Industry</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Advertising supports the core principles that shaped our nation: free speech, competition, and democracy. Since colonial times, advertising has provided a source of vital information about our open, market-based economy. Two Nobel Laureates in economics, Dr. Kenneth Arrow and the late Dr. George Stigler, praise the value of advertising: “Advertising is a powerful tool of competition. It provides valuable information about products and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In this way, advertising helps the economy to function smoothly—it keeps prices low and facilitates the entry of new products and new firms into the market.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_004">Kenneth Arrow and George Stigler, paper for the Advertising Tax Coalition, quoted in House Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures of the Committee on Ways and Means, <em class="emphasis">Miscellaneous revenue issues: hearings before the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures of the Committee on Ways and Means</em>, 103rd Cong., 1st sess., 1994, <a class="link" href="http://www.archive.org/stream/miscellaneousrev02unit/miscellaneousrev02unit_djvu.txt">http://www.archive.org/stream/miscellaneousrev02unit/miscellaneous rev02unit_djvu.txt</a> (accessed February 4, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s01_p02">U.S. advertising accounts for about 2.5 percent of the country’s $14 trillion gross national product. American consumers rely heavily on advertising to influence how they spend some $9 trillion annually on various goods and services. A 1999 study by one of the country’s premier econometric modeling firms, the WEFA Group, and Nobel Laureate in economics Dr. Lawrence R. Klein further underscored this economic impact. The study found that advertising played a key role in generating 18.2 million of the 126.7 million jobs in the United States in that year. The report further concluded that advertising expenditures contributed between 12 and 16 percent of private sector revenues throughout the country, in rural as well as urban areas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s01_p03">A later study, conducted in 2005 by the financial analysis firm Global Insight, demonstrated that advertising helps to generate more than $5.2 trillion in sales and economic activity throughout the U.S. economy annually. That represents 20 percent of the nation’s $25.5 trillion in total economic activity. This economic stimulus provided support throughout the economy for more than twenty-one million jobs, or 15.2 percent of the U.S. workforce. The purpose of the study was to quantify the economic and employment impacts of advertising. The study removed intervening effects (like consumers simply buying a product to replace an old one or a depleted one) to measure the role of advertising itself.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s01_p04">Advertising plays a strong role in the economy:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>It provides useful information to consumers that tells them about product and service choices, as well as comparing features, benefits, and prices. With more complete information, consumers and businesses often choose to purchase additional products and services.</li>
            <li>It “causes an economic chain reaction that (a) generates a net gain in direct sales and jobs due to the promotion of the industries’ products and services, (b) generates indirect sales and jobs among the first level suppliers to the industries that incur the advertising expenditures, and (c) generates indirect sales and jobs among all other levels of economic activity as the sales ripple throughout the economy.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_005">Global Insight, “The Comprehensive Economic Impact of Advertising Expenditures in the United States,” <a class="link" href="http://www.naa.org/Resources/Articles/Public-Policy-The-Comprehensive-Economic-Impact-of-Advertising-Expenditures-in-the-United-States/Public-Policy-The-Comprehensive-Economic-Impact-of-Advertising-Expenditures-in-the-United-States.aspx">http://www.naa.org/Resources/Articles/Public-Policy-The- Comprehensive-Economic-Impact-of-Advertising-Expenditures-in-the-United-States/Public-Policy-The-Comprehensive-Economic-Impact-of-Advertising-Expenditures- in-the-United-States.aspx</a> (accessed November 1, 2007).</span>
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s01_p05">Advertising also plays a significant role in the business cycle. As the broader economy shifts between periods of growth and recession, advertising shifts its focus. During downturns, like the one we’re in now, ads may focus on the price of a product or service. If one company curtails advertising in order to cut costs during a downturn, another company might boost ad spending to grab customers and grow its market share. Advertising helps stimulate economic growth. In a country in which consumer spending determines the future of the economy, advertising motivates people to spend more. By encouraging more buying, advertising promotes both job growth and productivity growth both to help meet increased demand and to enable each consumer to have more to spend.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Rationale to Create Advertising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s02_p01">Companies spend money on advertising because it increases sales of existing products, helps grow adoption of new products, builds brand loyalty, and takes sales away from competitors. Although the exact return on investment (ROI) varies tremendously across industries, companies, campaigns, and media channels, studies have found that a dollar spent on advertising returns $3–20 in additional sales. To compete and grow in today’s diverse, ever-changing marketplace, businesses must reach their target customers efficiently, quickly alerting them to new product introductions, improved product designs, and competitive price points. Advertising is by far the most efficient way to communicate such information.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Rationale to Accept Advertising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s03_p01">The economics of advertising extends to the media channels that depend on advertising revenues. Many forms of advertising support the creation of content and make that content available at a much lower price (or free). For example, roughly 75 percent of the cost of a newspaper is supported by advertising. If newspapers contained no advertising, they would cost four times as much to buy on the newsstand. Broadcast radio and TV rely exclusively on ads—people get news, music, and entertainment for free while advertisers get an audience. Forms of media that the public takes for granted would be extremely expensive to the reader or viewer or would simply be out of business without the revenues advertising produces. The demand created by advertising helps the economy to expand.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_006">S. William Pattis, <em class="emphasis">Careers in Advertising</em> (Blacklick, OH: McGraw-Hill Professional, 2004), 9.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s01_s03_p02">Advertising supports the arts. Advertisers need music that calls attention to the brand. Musical artists visit ad agencies to meet with directors of music and pitch songs to them that they can use in ads. They come to agencies because they know that companies spend tens of millions of dollars on media buys. “The major record labels don’t have that kind of money,” says Josh Rabinowitz, senior vice president and director of music at Grey Worldwide. What’s more, “TV ads give you the kind of heavy rotation you can’t get on MTV anymore. In the very near future, some of the best bands will produce jingles.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_007">Cora Daniels, “Adman Jangles for a Hit Jingle,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, July 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/117/fast-talk-rabinowitz.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/117/fast-talk-rabinowitz.html</a> (accessed February 4, 2009).</span></p>

The average adult is exposed to about 3,500 pieces of advertising information every single day—up from about 560 per day thirty years ago.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s01_p05">Here’s a statistic to chew on: American Internet users ages twelve and older spend an average of <em class="emphasis">6.1 hours per day</em> interacting with video-based entertainment. About four of these hours are devoted to television viewing (live and recorded), while the rest goes to video games, Web and PC video, DVDs, and video on mobile devices. This sizeable chunk of time is projected to grow to eight hours per day by 2013. Where will the growth come from? One answer is online video; Nielsen tells us that in 2007 Americans watched 7.5 billion streams and 16.4 billion minutes in total of online video, and children ages two to eleven spend almost one-third of their online time watching videos.

It turns out that dirty hands spread diseases like diarrhea that kill a child somewhere in the world <em class="emphasis">about every fifteen seconds</em>, and about half those deaths could be prevented with the regular use of soap.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Dr. Curtis, an anthropologist then living in Burkina Faso, was almost ready to throw in the towel (pardon the pun). Then she decided to ask some consumer goods companies how <em class="emphasis">they</em> would convince people to wash their hands using the same techniques they rely upon to sell vitamins or deodorant that people tend to consume out of habit. As she observed, “There are fundamental public health problems, like hand washing with soap, that remain killers only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits. We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_012">Charles Duhigg, “Warning: Habits May Be Good for You,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Magazine</em>, July 13, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html? pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20 for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1</a> (accessed July 17, 2008).</span> These companies know very well how to create and reinforce such habits. For example, a century ago it was rare for anyone to brush her teeth twice a day, but efforts by Colgate and others changed all that.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Public health campaigns have had limited success in changing unhealthy habits. For example, evidence suggests that antidrug campaigns actually <em class="emphasis">increase</em> drug use, presumably because they remind people about the drugs to which they’ve become attached. It’s sort of like telling someone, “Whatever you do, don’t think of an elephant.” Did that work?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p04">Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Unilever accepted Dr. Curtis’s challenge and joined an initiative called the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. The group’s goal was to double the handwashing rate in Ghana, a West African nation where almost every home contains a soap bar but only 4 percent of adults regularly lather up after they use the toilet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p05">When participants started to look into the issue, they had the insight that the problem resembled one Procter &amp; Gamble first encountered when it introduced Febreze, a product it developed to remove odors from smelly clothes and furniture. Its ads initially focused on smelly situations, like pets, sweaty teenagers, and stinky minivan interiors. The launch flopped, and P&amp;G was ready to kill the product. Then its researchers found that consumers liked Febreze when they used it, but that many customers simply forgot that it was in the house. P&amp;G’s ads needed to give them the right <em class="emphasis">cues</em> to use the product. The company identified one: the act of cleaning a room. So, it created commercials showing women spraying Febreze on a perfectly made bed and on freshly laundered clothing instead of in smelly areas. The ads worked well—and the more people sprayed Febreze, the more automatic the behavior became. Now consumers buy $650 million of the stuff each year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p06">Back to handwashing in Ghana: studies showed that while about half of the people washed their hands before they ate or after they used the bathroom, only about 4 percent of Ghanaians included soap in this process. They also found that mothers often didn’t see symptoms like diarrhea as abnormal but instead viewed them as a normal aspect of childhood. But they also unearthed an interesting tidbit: Ghanaians <em class="emphasis">did</em> use soap when they felt that their hands were dirty, for example, after they cooked with grease. This habit was prompted by feelings of <em class="emphasis">disgust</em>, and they applied soap to eliminate this bad feeling.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s02_p07">So the team came up with a big idea: create a habit to instill a feeling of disgust when people use the toilet, so that the emotional reaction would cue the use of soap. While many of us don’t hesitate to grimace at the thought of a less-than-sparkling bathroom, in many places in the developing world any toilet is a symbol of cleanliness, because flush toilets have replaced pit latrines. So the task was to create commercials to teach the audience to feel disgust after they went to the bathroom. The solution: the team shot ads of mothers and children walking out of bathrooms with a glowing purple pigment on their hands that contaminated everything they touched. These spots didn’t sell soap use, but rather disgust. Soap was almost an afterthought—one fifty-five-second television commercial only showed soapy hand washing for four seconds. Still, the link between disgust and its removal via soap was clear: the team’s follow-up research showed a 13 percent increase in the use of soap after the toilet, while the number of Ghanaians who reported washing their hands with soap before they eat rose by an impressive 41 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_013">Charles Duhigg, “Warning: Habits May Be Good for You,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Magazine</em>, July 13, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13habit.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Warning%20-%20Habits%20May%20Be%20Good%20for%20You&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1</a> (accessed July 17, 2008).</span> This is no soap opera: advertising can save lives when it’s used creatively and when it thoughtfully applies what social scientists understand about human behavior.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s04_p01">In the early twenty-first century, we are witnessing a profound shift in priorities as people clamor for products and services that are good for their bodies, good for their community, and good for the earth.

They estimate the U.S. market for body-friendly and earth-friendly products at more than $200 billion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s04_p02">In particular, some marketers single out a type of consumer they call <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">LOHAS</a><span class="glossdef">Consumers who worry about the environment and spend money to advance what they see as their personal development and potential; also called cultural creatives.</span></span>—an acronym for “lifestyles of health and sustainability.” This label refers to people who worry about the environment and spend money to advance what they see as their personal development and potential.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s04_p03">Just how widespread is conscientious consumerism? In a 2007 survey, eight in ten consumers said they believe it’s important to buy green products and that they’ll pay more to do so. Corporate responsibility is now one of the primary attributes shoppers look for when they decide among competing brands. Consumer research strongly suggests that this awareness often starts with personal health concerns and then radiates outward to embrace the community and the environment. Predictably, advertisers have been quick to jump on the green bandwagon. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Green marketing</a><span class="glossdef">Advertising and marketing that emphasizes how products and services are environmentally responsible.</span></span>, which emphasizes how products and services are environmentally responsible, is red hot. Established agencies are setting up divisions to specialize in green campaigns and a host of new agencies (with names like The Green Agency and Green Team) are opening to meet the demand.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s02_s04_p04">The advertising industry has the potential to radically change people’s attitudes and (more importantly) their behaviors as we face the real consequences of environmental contamination. Unfortunately, there’s also the very real potential that it will “poison the well” as it jumps onto the bandwagon a bit <em class="emphasis">too</em> energetically. It’s almost impossible to find an ad for virtually any kind of product, service, or company that doesn’t tout its environmental credentials, whether the focus of the ad is a detergent, a garment, a commercial airplane, or even an oil company. As a result, complaints about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">greenwashing</a><span class="glossdef">Advertising and marketing that misleads consumers about a product’s environmental benefits.</span></span>, or misleading consumers about a product’s environmental benefits, are skyrocketing.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s01_p03">Indeed, advertising can affect a person’s self-esteem when it takes advantage of our powerful instinct to gauge our physical and mental states relative to others. Numerous studies have noted that female college students compare their physical appearance to that of models in ads. Participants who viewed ads with beautiful women expressed lower satisfaction with their own appearance afterwards than did women who didn’t see these ads. Another study showed that as little as thirty minutes of TV programming can alter young women’s perceptions of their own body shape.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_023">Cited in Michael R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s01_p04">One of the prevailing arguments in the history of advertising is whether advertising merely reflects existing cultural values and views of gender or whether it constructs and creates those views. Some analysts believe that advertising is merely a “mirror” of culture. Others argue that advertising is a “distorted mirror” that both reflects and shapes our culture.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_024">Richard W.

Denise Fedewa, senior vice president and planning director for the LeoShe subsidiary of the Leo Burnett agency, presented an updated, unified view when she said, “Advertising is so fascinating, because it’s both a mirror of the culture and it moves culture forward. I think the best advertising…taps into a direction that we are moving in, but we are not there yet, and it helps take us there…I think we’ve gotten a lot better at doing that…in tapping into where they [women] are moving next.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_025">Eileen Fischer, “Interview with Denise Fedewa,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising and Society Review</em> 4, no. 4 (2003), <a class="link" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/advertising_and_society_review/toc/asr4.4.html">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/advertising_and_society_review/toc/asr4.4.html</a>.</span></p>

Unilever (which makes Dove soap) initiated the Campaign for Real Beauty after its research showed that many women didn’t believe its products worked because the women shown using them were so unrealistic.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_026">Erin White, “Dove ‘Firms’ with Zaftig Models: Unilever Brand Launches European Ads Employing Non-Supermodel Bodies,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, April 21, 2004, B3.</span> The marketers decided to focus the campaign’s message on reassuring women about their insecurities by showing them as they are—wrinkles, freckles, pregnant bellies, and all. Taglines ask “Oversized or Outstanding?” and “Wrinkled or Wonderful?” Dove even has a Web site (campaignforrealbeauty.com) where visitors can view the ads and cast their votes. For a real treat (and to appreciate how much “postproduction editing” goes into the fashion business), see how experts morph an average woman into a billboard beauty on this Dove Web site: <a class="link" href="http://www.boardsmag.com/screeningroom/commercials/3421">http://www.boardsmag.com/screeningroom/commercials/3421</a>.</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s01_p06">Perhaps because of the success of the Dove campaign, other companies also are turning to ordinary people instead of professional models when they advertise. As an extension of its “I’m lovin’ it” campaign, McDonald’s held a casting call for consumers (as opposed to professional models) who will appear on its world cup and bag packaging.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s01_p08">So, which way is it? Is advertising a mirror or an idealized picture? It’s likely that advertising both reflects and affects gender roles in our daily lives. Since the 1970s, researchers have investigated the extent to which American advertising portrays women in stereotypical roles. Most report that ads do tend to portray women as subservient to men, as preoccupied with physical attractiveness, and as sex objects who are preoccupied with their appearance, and they tend to minimize depictions of women in positions of authority. To rub salt into the wound, this media exposure can indeed influence real women’s self-concepts and aspirations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_028">Earl D.

Using the example of the ads for Charlie perfume in the 1970s and 1980s, he shows how this advertising provided the imagery of the new woman in the workplace: striving, not strident, proud of her accomplishments and not afraid to say so, but not the dour “make room for me or else” feminist that the press portrayed at the time. Twitchell’s view is that Madison Avenue is not immoral in imposing stereotypes but <em class="emphasis">amoral</em> in reflecting prevailing roles; that is, advertising follows whichever way the wind is blowing.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Ads reinforce negative ethnic and racial stereotypes</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s02_p02">Advertisements have a long history of relying on stereotypical characters to promote products. For many years Aunt Jemima sold pancake mix and Rastus was a grinning black chef who pitched Cream of Wheat hot cereal. The Gold Dust Twins were black urchins who peddled a soap powder for Lever Brothers and Pillsbury hawked powdered drink mixes using characters such as Injun Orange and Chinese Cherry—who had buck teeth.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s02_p03">These negative depictions began to decline in the 1960s as the civil rights movement gave more power to minority groups and their rising economic status began to command marketers’ respect. Frito-Lay responded to protests by the Hispanic community and stopped using the Frito Bandito character in 1971, and Quaker Foods gave Aunt Jemima a makeover in 1989. As part of its fiftieth-anniversary celebration for Crest toothpaste, Procter &amp; Gamble reintroduced its “Crest Kid,” who first appeared in 1956 as a “white bread,” apple-cheeked girl painted by artist Norman Rockwell. It’s telling that the new Crest Kid is Cuban American. Similarly, a recent campaign gives a radical makeover to the black Uncle Ben character who appeared on rice packages for more than sixty years dressed as a servant. (White Southerners once used “uncle” and “aunt” as honorary names for older African Americans because they refused to address them as “Mr.” and “Mrs.”) The character is remade as Ben (just Ben), an accomplished businessman with an opulent office who shares his “grains of wisdom” about rice and life on the brand’s Web site.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_034">Marty Westerman, “Death of the Frito Bandito,” <em class="emphasis">American Demographics</em>, March 1989, 28; Stuart Elliott, “Uncle Ben, Board Chairman,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> <em class="emphasis">Online</em>, March 30, 2007 (accessed March 30, 2007); <a class="link" href="http://www.unclebens.com">http://www.unclebens.com</a> (accessed February 1, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s02_p04">These positive steps are motivated by both good intentions and pragmatism. Ethnic minorities spend more than $600 billion a year on products and services. Immigrants make up 10 percent of the U.S. population, and California is less than half Caucasian. Advertisers and their agencies couldn’t ignore this new reality even if they wanted to.</p>

NebuAd, one particularly controversial form of tracking software, tracks users wherever they go on the Web. Company executives claim the data can’t be traced back to individuals; instead, the software categorizes consumers as they surf the Web. Marketers then buy ads to appear online before certain subgroups of consumers when the technology recognizes their encrypted identity. Categories can be made quite specific; for example, you could come to the attention of an appliance manufacturer if you searched for “microwave ovens” within the past month.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_036">Emily Steel and Vishesh Kumar, “Targeted Ads Raise Privacy Concerns: Pressure Could Imperil Online Strategy Shared by Phone and Cable-TV Firms,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, July 8, 2008, B1.</span></p>

People are particularly concerned that businesses or individuals will target their children. Nearly 70 percent of consumers worry about keeping their information private, but according to a Jupiter Media Metrix survey, only 40 percent read privacy policies posted on business Web sites. And many consumers seem more than happy to trade some of their personal information in exchange for information they consider more useful to them.

The popular social networking site ignited a huge controversy after it rolled out a marketing tool it calls Beacon in 2007. Facebook users discovered that their off-Facebook Web activities—such as purchases at online retailers, reviews at other sites, and auction bids, among other things—were being broadcast to their friends. The idea behind Beacon is to offer “trusted referrals”; if my Facebook friends see that I’ve been buying stuff at Alloy, they’ll be more likely to check out the site as well. Unfortunately, the folks at Facebook neglected to ask users if they would consent to share this information. In response to heated criticism, founder Mark Zuckerberg was forced to post a shamefaced apology, and Facebook now allows users to opt out of Beacon completely.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p01"><em class="emphasis">Ads create false needs that make us crave brand names and material possessions</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p02">The validity of this criticism depends on how you define a “need.” If we believe that all consumers need is the basic functional benefits of products—the transportation a car provides, the nutrition we get from food, and the clean hair from a shampoo—then advertising may be guilty as charged. If, on the other hand, you think you need a car that projects a cool image, food that tastes fantastic, and a shampoo that makes your hair shine and smell ever so nice, then advertising is just a vehicle that communicates those more intangible benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p03">Critics say that advertising makes us buy products that we don’t need—or even want—but that we think we must have. In his seminal book <em class="emphasis">The Affluent Society</em>, economist John Kenneth Galbraith portrayed advertising as “manipulating the public by creating artificial needs and wants.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_040">John Kenneth Galbraith, <em class="emphasis">The Affluent Society</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1958), as cited in William M. O’Barr, “What Is Advertising?” <em class="emphasis">Advertising &amp; Society Review</em> 6, no. 3 (2005): 11.</span> He charged that radio and TV manipulate the masses. His view was that ads created new desires, encouraging consumers to spend their scarce resources buying highly advertised products rather than on basic items that fulfilled actual needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p04">Galbraith voiced a common fear—that marketers link their products to desirable social attributes so that people feel measured by what they buy and guilty or anxious if they don’t measure up. As an example, when the eminent psychologist John Watson joined the J. Walter Thompson (now JWT) advertising agency, he worked on a campaign for Johnson’s baby powder. In a 1925 lecture, he explained how he increased sales of the baby powder by making the mother who did not use it “feel bad, that she was less of a mother, not really a good mother.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_041">John Watson quoted in Humphrey McQueen, <em class="emphasis">The Essence of Capitalism</em> (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2003), 157.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p05">But is advertising really all-powerful? The reality is that 40 percent to 80 percent of all new products fail. Advertising can’t magically make a product succeed (at least for very long) if it doesn’t have some merit. Johnson’s baby powder would not still be on store shelves after more than 110 years if it didn’t provide some benefit. As one former advertising agency president noted, “The fact of the matter is we are successful in selling good products and unsuccessful in selling poor ones. In the end, consumer satisfaction, or lack of it, is more powerful than all our tools and ingenuity put together. You know the story: we had the perfect dog food except for one thing—the dog wouldn’t eat it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_042">Association of National Advertisers, “The Role of Advertising in America,” <a class="link" href="http://www.ana.net/advocacy2/content/advamerica">http://www.ana.net/advocacy2/content/advamerica</a> (accessed February 4, 2009).</span> The heart of the matter is: does advertising give people what they want, or does it tell them what they <em class="emphasis">should</em> want?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p06">In fact, we can even make the argument (one that advertisers such as high-end stores like Neiman-Marcus, Prada, or Tiffany surely will welcome) that we should want things we can’t afford. According to author James Twitchell, not everyone can buy a $200 cashmere sweater from Saks for their baby—but we can always dream of owning one. He claims that such a collective dream life is important to the continuing vigor of a culture. In the bigger scheme of things, advertising is a simple reflection of an age-old drive: “Human beings did not suddenly become materialistic. We have always been desirous of things.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_043">James Twitchell, <em class="emphasis">Living It Up: Our Love Affair with Luxury</em> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2002).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p07">Luxury products are not a bad or wasteful thing (goes this argument) because history shows that one generation’s decadent indulgence becomes the next generation’s bare necessity. Former luxury products that are now in daily use include buttons, window glass, rugs, door handles, pillows, mirrors, combs, and umbrellas, not to mention cars, electric lights, and indoor plumbing. The phenomenon of striving to afford “luxury” is the driving force for a rising standard of living. When we buy a luxury good, we increase the demand for it, which leads companies to produce more of it, ultimately leading to lower prices that make it affordable to the masses. At the same time that each new luxury creates new demand, it also creates the potential for a new industry with new jobs that enable people to afford the new luxuries. People become individually and collectively richer as they strive to buy new products and create new businesses to make these products.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p09">Is Adbusters right? Does advertising encourage us to be shallow, or to value material rewards over spiritual ones? The jury is still out on that question, but there is little doubt that ads reinforce the things our society values. Images of happy (and popular) people who drive gas guzzlers and eat junk food surround us.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch03_s03_s04_p10">Because it’s so powerful, advertising can hurt as well as help us. A consumer would have to live in a deep hole not to be affected by the images of “shiny happy people” (to quote from the REM song of the same name) that constantly bombard us. To decide whether advertising causes us to feel insecure about our bodies, engage in self-destructive behaviors, or covet others’ possessions is to raise a chicken-and-egg question that elicits strong feelings on both sides (just ask your professor). Nonetheless, whether they create the problems or merely perpetuate them, advertising practitioners certainly need to remind themselves (preferably every day) of the power they wield. Hopefully, if you go into the biz, you’ll remember that too.</p>

One site, Chemistry.com, claims in its advertising that answers to questions like “Do you watch people kissing in public?” and “Is your ring finger longer than your index finger?” can predict whether the people it matches up are likely to have “dating chemistry.” The site’s rival eHarmony.com objected to this claim and brought its charge to the NAD. After investigating the scientific basis for the claim, the division ruled that indeed Chemistry could not support its argument. As a result, the matchmaker has to find other ways to compete for the $700 million Americans spend each year to find their dream mate online.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn03_050">Jessica E.

Though this vision might be optimistic at this point in time, electric and alternative-fuel cars are realities just over the horizon. Refueling stations for electric cars will most likely not resemble the corner or freeway gas station. Instead, refueling sites are more likely to look like roadside parks. Refueling stations that recharge batteries may have solar roofs that provide the current for the refueling. Since refueling is expected to take several minutes, refueling stations will provide for rest and activities.

In case you didn’t know this, it is Bluetooth technology, developed by communication giant Ericsson, that enables all of our electronic and informational devices to talk to one another. For example, Bluetooth technology enables wireless headsets to communicate with other devices. You might have noticed that Aliph has just introduced a new Bluetooth-enabled headset called Jawbone that is smaller, lighter, and cuts wind noise more than any previous headset designs. The headset is about the size of a large rectangular earring or about one-half the size of existing headset models. There is, however, a significant problem that must be addressed before headset communication is advised for everyone. There are reports linking forms of brain cancer to cell phone and headset use. Experts are studying the possibilities and connections. No conclusions have been reached yet. Your task is to assume that you are a member of the Advertising Council and have been asked to design a PSA (public service announcement) that will both quiet fears and encourage information-seeking about the subject as research progresses.

        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch03_s05_p04">According to media and advertising critics, one of the chief causes of negative body image among teens and younger adults is the models used to display everything from cars to fashions to makeup. As indicated in the chapter, body image “refers to a person’s subjective evaluation of his or her physical self.” The key word is “subjective.” Messages are open to different interpretation. Critics claim advertising messages by their very nature cause consumers to reject their current situation or status quo and embrace change toward some ideal state as specified by the advertiser. If true, this could have a negative impact on those who read or view commercials, especially those who are younger and more impressionable.</p>

One of your collages should illustrate unrealistic body images displayed in commercials that are, in your opinion, ethically questionable. The other collage should illustrate what you perceive to be a more realistic and ethical way to deal with the presentation of body image. Once they are completed, compare your collages; comment on where you think this debate over body image might be headed in the next few years. Be prepared to discuss your collages, thoughts, and position.</p>
