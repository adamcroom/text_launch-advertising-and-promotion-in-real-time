        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s06_s01_p01">Most of us eagerly solicit others’ opinions about brands, but we don’t pay attention to just anyone.

Rogers, <em class="emphasis">Diffusion of Innovations</em>, 3rd ed.

For example, the BzzAgent word-of-mouth network identifies people who like to talk to others about products. The company recruits BzzAgents at its Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.bzzagent.com">http://www.bzzagent.com</a>), where it invites prospective agents to be “part of a growing international network of over 425,000 consumers” who share their honest opinions about its clients’ products with people they know.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_043"><a class="link" href="http://www.bzzagent.com/signup/NewAgentSignup.do">http://www.bzzagent.com/signup/NewAgentSignup.do</a> (accessed July 8, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s06_s01_s02_p01">Unlike an informal opinion leader, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">surrogate consumer</a><span class="glossdef">A person who is hired by others to provide input into their purchase decisions.</span></span> is a person whom we hire to provide input into our purchase decisions. These include interior decorators, stockbrokers, professional shoppers, and even college consultants who help prospective students identify schools that will be the best match for them. Surrogates can exert a huge influence on consumers’ decisions. Advertisers tend to overlook surrogates when they try to convince consumers to buy their goods or services. This can be a big mistake: they may mistarget their communications to end consumers instead of to the surrogates who actually sift through product information and decide among product alternatives. For example, in many cases (particularly for more affluent people) it’s an interior designer who makes a lot of decisions about the furnishings a client will put into a room; the client just writes the check.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_047">Michael R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch04_s06_s02_s01_p02">Why are reference groups so persuasive?

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s06_s02_s04_p03">For many years BMW’s advertising has emphasized its sophisticated engineering as it appealed to affluent car enthusiasts. Lately, however, the company is broadening its message to be one of innovation and independence, as it hopes to entice drivers who are more captivated by the style of a car’s interior than the engine that sits under the hood. In one ad, the company highlights the design for a glass-walled new factory in Leipzig rather than a car model. Its strategy is to appeal to what it calls “the idea class”: self-motivated architects, professionals, and entrepreneurs who value authenticity and independent thinking. They buy luxury cars, but they’re not car nuts.</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch04_s06_s02_s04_p04">Why the change? An internal study found that of the 1.9 million consumers who bought luxury cars in a recent year, 1.4 million didn’t even consider BMW. About six hundred thousand of those non–BMW purchasers said they were looking for a car that’s fun to drive. A BMW marketing executive noted that for the company, “that is low-hanging fruit.” Still, many of those buyers instead drove home a Saab, Infiniti, Acura, or Lexus. The new ads were created by GSD&amp;M/Idea City, BMW’s ad agency, to convince these people that the values of innovation and independent thinking run deep in the company’s corporate culture (presumably in contrast to larger automakers that aren’t as free to innovate). As this executive observed, “It should appeal to the idea class that we are independent, that we are free to do something.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn04_052">Quoted in Neal E. Boudette and Gina Chon, “Brawny BMW Seeks ‘The Idea Class,’” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, August 2, 2006, B1.</span></p>
