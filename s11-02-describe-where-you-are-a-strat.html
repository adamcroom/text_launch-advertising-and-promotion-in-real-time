    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_p02">Now that we understand the value of brands, it is time to get down to the business of strategy creation. Plan now, or regret it later! Here’s what an advertising strategist needs to do:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_l02">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Identify Your Situation</em>. What are your strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_p03">Fundamentally, our goal is to take a thorough internal look at our product, service, and firm. We must be objective. This is hard. Catherine joined msnbc.com and immediately began to understand the product itself and the brand. She must summarize where the current offering is positioned, identify where she wants it to be positioned, and then create an overall strategy to connect those dots. Getting this part right makes the rest of the challenge (and this book) easy. Getting it wrong…</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Situation Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_p01">Before you can decide where to go, you need to understand where you are (the current marketing situation or environment). Use secondary and primary research as discussed in <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch07#solomon-ch07">Chapter 7 "Decide What You Can Afford to Say: msnbc.com Sets the Budget"</a> to inform your assessment of the full situation. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">situation analysis</a><span class="glossdef">An assessment of where the brand currently is, including the competitive situation, customer situation, and economic and cultural trends.</span></span> is an important tool to help you with this process.</p>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Competitive Situation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p01">A situation analysis begins with a review of the client’s industry and of the competitors vying for the consumer’s attention and dollars. For example, a situation analysis might reveal that some companies in the industry may not actually be competitors; buyers of Hyundais are unlikely to be buyers of BMWs as well. It may also reveal indirect competition in an industry. Southwest Airlines, for example, tries to price its airline tickets low enough to compete with buses and automobiles.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p02">msnbc.com understood its competitors to reach beyond just other online news sites such as CNN.com or NYTimes.com. Its competition also included news aggregators or portals such as Google News as well as broader and new information sources such as Digg and Gawker.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Situation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p01">The situation analysis also evaluates the potential customers (prospects) for your product. This might include estimating the potential population of customers, demographic changes (such as aging Baby Boomers), potential sales per customer, trends in willingness to pay, and so on. Note that for consumer goods companies, the “customer” may be either the end consumer or the retailer. Thus, Wal-Mart is a major customer for consumer goods companies like Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p02">As we learned in the section in <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch06#solomon-ch06">Chapter 6 "Segment, Target, and Position Your Audience: SS+K Identifies the Most Valuable News Consumer"</a> on segmenting the audience, msnbc.com started understanding its audience as a broader group of online news users. As the research progressed, it learned about msnbc.com lovers and news junkies—users who need more and more stimulation from what they read in order to be satisfied—ultimately leading to the definition of the <em class="emphasis">News Explorer</em> as the most valuable audience for the upcoming branding campaign.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s02_n01">
                <h3 class="title">SS+K Spotlight</h3>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p03"><em class="emphasis">Target identification</em>: “What was it about explorers and addicts and junkies that sets them apart from the rest of us?”</p>
                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s02_p04">In order to develop authentic, relevant communication with a target audience, you need to understand who they are. Think about trying to categorize the vast numbers and types of people who might prefer msnbc.com. Then overlay that image with all the different regular uses for the site—news, entertainment, research, passing time—and the task of defining a target consumer can seem mind-boggling. Demographics alone don’t sketch an adequate picture of the intended audience. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch06#solomon-ch06">Chapter 6 "Segment, Target, and Position Your Audience: SS+K Identifies the Most Valuable News Consumer"</a>, instead of targeting a group bounded by readily identifiable markers such as socioeconomic class, age, or gender, SS+K wanted to discover how its audience might be unified by a mindset.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Economic and Cultural Trends</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s01_s03_p01">Finally, the situation analysis examines overall economic and environmental trends that may affect a company’s marketplace situation. Economic growth or recession affects total demand for a product. Fewer people buy expensive houses when companies are downsizing. Foreign exchange rates may change the costs or make the company more competitive in foreign markets because the dollar may be worth less in another country—as a result it costs more dollars to manufacture the product elsewhere. Changes in costs can affect both prices and profits. For example, a drop in technology costs might cause a company to lower the prices on the goods it produces, possibly reducing profits. By contrast, a rise in fuel costs might force a company like Delta Airlines to raise its prices; if the company can’t increase prices enough to make up for the additional costs, its profits will decline. Changes in the cultural environment also exert a huge impact on a company’s fortunes. For a news Web site like msnbc.com, for example, the number and types of people who visit the site is influenced by the penetration of Internet access in different areas, the lure of alternative online platforms like virtual worlds or even Twitter, and the number of people who begin to use their cell phones as their primary “screen.”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Brand Audit</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand audit</a><span class="glossdef">Assessment that examines the health of a brand and identifies areas of additional value and ways to improve brand equity.</span></span> helps a company understand the health of its brand, identify areas of additional value, and improve brand equity. A firm should conduct brand audits regularly—at least yearly—to ensure that the brand stays relevant, unique, and strong.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p02">The story of Nortel, a telecommunications equipment maker, offers an example of the importance of a regular brand audit. Nortel was struggling during an industry downturn and an accounting scandal. Its chief competitor, Cisco Systems, had an advertising budget almost six times the size of Nortel’s. Nortel’s new chief marketing officer, Lauren Flaherty, decided it was time to undertake a global brand audit to get a feel for how customers, employees, and shareholders perceived Nortel and what the company needed to do to reshape its brand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p03">Before the audit, Flaherty met with marketing executives throughout the company to assess Nortel’s marketing communications capabilities, as well as the capabilities of its ad agency and public relations firm. “The first priority is to understand, by target audience, what is the communications challenge with each constituency,” she said. “We will create a very systematic blueprint for who we communicate with, how we communicate, and the whole marketing mix.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn08_002">Kate Maddox, “Nortel CMO Begins Global Brand” <em class="emphasis">B to B</em>, May 8, 2006, 3.</span> Nortel’s audit allowed the company to get a more realistic feel for its market position so that its advertising could more precisely communicate its value proposition.</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p04">msnbc.com’s brand audit highlights:</p>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p05">On the surface, the marriage of Microsoft’s technology with NBC’s content looked like a happy one, but beneath the surface there was confusion. Many of msnbc.com’s people defined the brand based on their role at the organization. As discussed in the <a class="xref" href="solomon-ch05#solomon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Know Your Audience: SS+K Learns All About msnbc.com, Inside and Out"</a> section on research and the msnbc.com stakeholder interviews, the technology side of the organization (the people who make the site function) identified more heavily with Microsoft, while employees who worked on the news side identified more with the NBC brand. By defining the brand based on their roles at msnbc.com, they lacked a cohesive umbrella definition, and as a result the organization wasn’t yet able to articulate its meaning to the outside world. Additional points contributed to the lack of clarity:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>msnbc.com is laden with brands: MSNBC cable TV, specific NBC TV program brands like <em class="emphasis">The Today Show</em>, branded personalities like Brian Williams, and brands they do not own but host on the site, such as <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>. Add to this mix the connection to MSN, and there was plenty of complexity and confusion regarding just what msnbc.com consists of.</li>
                <li>MSNBC cable has run a distant third in the twenty-four-hour news channel race. As a result, it hasn’t endowed msnbc.com with the brand equity afforded its rivals like CNN and the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, which have strong cross-channel representation.</li>
                <li>The association with NBC News lends an important credibility and character to the site, but broadcast news channels in general have failed to attract users in large numbers to their Web versions. The success of msnbc.com hadn’t depended on drawing users to TV news online, and its future did not lie in repurposing broadcast news.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_n02">
            <h3 class="title">SS+K Spotlight</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p06">SS+K conducted a situation analysis for its client, msnbc.com. It was vital for the agency to understand how people thought about the news service—especially compared to its major competitors. What products did it deliver well? What kind of personality did it have? The documents below reflect some of the agency’s findings.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p07"><em class="emphasis">Identifying a competitive opportunity</em>. The picture was a bit muddy: although the marriage between Microsoft and NBC made the news service unique, there was confusion about the best way to tell the client’s story to consumers. Was the site about cutting-edge technology or unique content? Should it focus on breaking news or on in-depth feature stories?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p08">Further probing with consumer focus groups, however, revealed an opening. When asked to compare the client’s personality to other news Web sites, people described msnbc.com as more friendly, colorful, and younger—if the site came to life, they thought it would be the characteristics that popular news anchor Katie Couric represented. This was a more positive personality description than the groups gave for the serious demeanor of CNN.com (who would have characteristics of an Englishman) or of the nondescript Yahoo! + Google News (whose traits would be like a traffic cop!). As a result, msnbc.com saw an opportunity to position itself as <em class="emphasis">entertaining news</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s02_p09">Further probing revealed that people regarded msnbc.com as less biased than other news sites—either to the left (CNN.com) or to the right (Fox News). Compared to CNN.com, people felt that msnbc.com offered more variety, emotion, and potential to discover interesting things. In other words, the competition provided plenty of information, but not content that excited the imagination. At last, here was an advantage SS+K could run with: let’s think of the core customer as a News Explorer who enjoys the experience of discovering and unearthing new pieces of news and information from what he or she reads.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch08_s02_s03_s01_p01">This refers to strengths and weaknesses inherent to the product or business itself.

For a bicycle firm like Schwinn, on the other hand, aging Boomers might be a threat, since people are likely to bicycle less as they grow older.</p>
