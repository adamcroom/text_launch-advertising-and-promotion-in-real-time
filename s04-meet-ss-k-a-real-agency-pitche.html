        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s01_s01_p01">The textbook publishing industry is undergoing staggering change as many traditional business models and practices quickly lose relevance. Peer-to-peer textbook trading networks, online used-book sellers, and a gray market that allows low-priced international editions to displace expensive U.S. texts push publishers to reconsider outmoded ways of delivering content. Likewise, the digital natives who make up our university student bodies (that’s you!) inspire educators to think about the transfer of knowledge in exciting new ways.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s01_s01_p02">How do we best communicate the most current thinking in our disciplines to students who expect up-to-the-minute information at a keystroke and who view educational materials as community—indeed, world—resources that can and should be shared and interactively constructed?</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_p02">Get to know Shepardson, Stern and Kaminsky (SS+K) as it works on a campaign for msnbc.com, a media brand in search of an identity. SS+K opened its doors in 1993 and now has offices in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. With over $70 million in billings, SS+K is an independent agency owned by its partners, with a minority ownership by Creative Artists Agency (CAA)—perhaps the most powerful talent and literary agency in the world. CAA also owns the Intelligence Group, a market research and trend forecasting company.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_p03">For this text, we interview the agency partners, the creative director, the account people, the creative team (copywriter and art director), the public relations experts, the account planners and research specialists, and the digital professionals who took the msnbc.com campaign from pitch to completion. And, a member of our author team knows this agency up close and personal: Amit Nizan was the account manager at SS+K who lived and breathed the msnbc.com campaign. A 2003 graduate of the renowned undergraduate advertising program at the University of Florida, Amit will help us take you through the planning and execution of this campaign as a young, dynamic advertising professional actually experienced it. Not too long ago she was a student just like you, so she feels your pain!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_p04">Through their words and documents you will follow, step by step, the thirteen-month process of bringing SS+K’s campaign vision of “A Fuller Spectrum of News” to light. To allow us to bring you the inside story on how the agency created the msnbc.com campaign, msnbc.com and SS+K granted FWK full access to its creative work, internal processes, and employees. The result is a resource that offers new ways to teach and talk about the real world of advertising with course content that is affordable, accessible, timely, and relevant. Welcome to advertising education on steroids.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">OK, So Who Is SS+K?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01_p01">SS+K was founded in 1993 by three former political consultants—Rob Shepardson, Lenny Stern, and Mark Kaminsky—and a famous copywriter, David McCall. To this day, the agency is a mash-up of those roots in politics and creativity, bolstered by a dose of entertainment marketing via its partnership with CAA and the staff’s passion to learn and apply the latest technology. SS+K has become a haven for talented refugees from every corner of the communications world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01_p02">SS+K offers a full array of services to its clients, including advertising, marketing, design, public relations, public affairs, and research. Although many ad agencies, PR firms, and marketing consultancies endorsed integrated strategies over the last decade, SS+K believes that most agencies have built-in biases toward one type of solution. They tend to treat “integration” as an item on a check-off list. Ad agencies think in terms of ads. PR shops generate PR ideas. And so on…but not SS+K. For them, it is about delivering <em class="emphasis">the right message at the right time to the right audience with the right medium</em>. They call their approach to these types of media-neutral ideas <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Asymmetric Communications</a><span class="glossdef">SS+K’s trademarked technique of mapping their client’s issue, brand, competition, and target audience to develop a big idea that will drive their marketing and communications.</span></span>. Their perspective encourages the agency to “think outside the box” by employing a mix of traditional and new media (like urban games) to engage the audience in surprising ways and uncover opportunities to connect with them.</p>
        <div class="figure medium editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 1.4</span> View of the Brooklyn Bridge from SS+K’s New York Office</p>
            <img src="section_04/5dd9624ba67a7862bccb8c9c454af530.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01_p03">This perspective is a consumer-centric approach the agency uses to find unique and surprising ways for clients to connect with and engage their target audiences. For example, instead of using traditional methods and messaging to increase awareness of Qwest Wireless among high school students, Qwest worked with SS+K to design an urban game called ConQwest that involved teams of students, newly created semacodes for use on cell phones, and giant inflatable game pieces. Semacode is a trade name for machine-readable two-dimensional black and white symbols that act as “barcode URLs.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01_p04">True to their political roots, the agency consulted with the Obama presidential campaign on driving more interest and participation among young voters. Since its inception, SS+K has maintained a high-profile nonprofit business, including work with UNICEF, Share Our Strength, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Lance Armstrong Foundation’s “LIVE<strong class="emphasis bold">STRONG</strong>” campaign.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01_p05">The agency understands how to work with short lead times and mine for deep consumer insights that animate its work. It’s a combination that has made SS+K increasingly popular with a growing roster of clients, including Delta Airlines, Credo Mobile, Polo Ralph Lauren, AutoMart—and our client for this book, msnbc.com.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s01_p06">After fifteen years in business, all three founding partners—Rob Shephardson, Lenny Stern, and Mark Kaminsky—are still active in the firm, and they’ve added other key partners such as Executive Creative Director Marty Cooke to continue to provide fresh ideas and leadership.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How SS+K Works</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s03_p01">How is an ad agency <em class="emphasis">not</em> an ad agency? SS+K does not consider itself an advertising agency, but instead a creatively-driven strategic communications firm that solves problems through a variety of innovative techniques—including but not limited to traditional advertising approaches. You’re going to see throughout this book that SS+K is not alone in this regard—the advertising industry seems to change its stripes almost daily as new technologies and trends evolve!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s02_s03_p02">As a remnant from SS+K’s founders’ days as political consultants the agency uses an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">integrated model</a><span class="glossdef">A full array of services offered to clients including advertising, marketing, design, public relations, public affairs, and research.</span></span>.

    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <p class="para" id="solomon-ch01_s03_p01">After studying this section, students should be able to do the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="solomon-ch01_s03_l01">
            <li>Understand the process by which an agency makes a pitch for a client’s business by responding to a Request for Proposal.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_p02">How does the client decide which agencies to work with? It all starts with the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pitch</a><span class="glossdef">Process in which a client invites an agency to present itself with the hope of winning the account.</span></span>, where the client invites an agency to present itself with the hope of winning the account.

In an RFP, the client lays out basic information about its business and requirements for the job, along with a list of questions that will help the client determine how the agencies work and if they are suited to the task at hand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_p03">In some cases, agencies may approach clients they feel would be a good match for their talents or would add depth or luster to their roster. Alternatively, when agencies are well known for a particular campaign or approach, clients will seek them out. However, just as when an individual is searching for work, word of mouth and personal relationships play an important role in the process. It’s not just what you know, it’s <em class="emphasis">who</em> you know.</p>
    <div class="section" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Why the Pitch Is Such a Big Deal</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s01_p01">The client’s stake in agency pitches is high: management’s jobs, the brand’s future, and millions of dollars may ride on the campaigns the winning agency creates. For example, in 2007, despite having spent over $900 million on marketing that year, Microsoft was not performing well against competitors such as Google and Apple. Identifying a key need to boost market share, the software giant embarked on a search for a new agency to enhance its brand image. By February of 2008, Microsoft had narrowed its search to two agencies; it then chose Crispin Porter + Bogusky for a new $200–300 million “consumer blitz.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn01_001">Rupal Parekh and Alice Z. Cuneo, “Microsoft Narrows to Crispin, Fallon,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, December 21, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://adage.com/agencynews/article?article_id=122776">http://adage.com/agencynews/article?article_id=122776</a> (accessed July 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s01_p02">Just as the client invests large sums in the advertising campaign, the <em class="emphasis">costs</em> for agencies also are enormous, whether or not they win the business. In order to pitch effectively, the agency must allocate material resources and a tremendous number of team hours to meetings, research, and creation of the pitch. Sometimes, when the assignment, chemistry, or timing isn’t right, it’s just good business for the agency to walk away and leave millions of dollars in potential billings on the table.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s01_p03">That’s what happened in 2006, when GSD&amp;M (now known as GSD&amp;M Idea City)’s nineteen-year relationship with its client Wal-Mart was challenged in a client-initiated review for their business. In one of the first review meetings the incumbent agency had with its longstanding client, GSD&amp;M agency president Roy Spence played a clip from the movie <em class="emphasis">Dumb and Dumber</em>, in which the romantically challenged character played by Jim Carrey is told by the girl of his dreams the chances they will be together are one in a million. Carrey replies, “So…you’re telling me there’s a chance?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn01_002">“Wal-Mart, Please Don’t Leave Me,” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, October 9, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_41/b4004076.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_41/b4004076.htm</a> (accessed July 16, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s01_p04">Spence’s attempt at lightheartedness hid a hard truth: there was no salvaging the relationship. GSD&amp;M was unsuccessful in its pitch for the business, which included a poorly received report suggesting that Wal-Mart’s declining reputation was at the root of its struggle for higher share prices. In an interesting turn of events, the agency that “won” the business, Draft FCB/Chicago, was dropped in a matter of months, and Wal-Mart once again invited GSD&amp;M to pitch its business. This time, GSD&amp;M swallowed hard and passed on a chance at the $580 million assignment. Like the song goes, you gotta know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Who Conducts the Pitch?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s02_p01">Marketers who work on the brand for the client are the ones who initiate the pitch process when they make the decision that they would like to search for an agency. The person within the organization who generally leads the search is the chief marketing officer or the vice president of marketing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s02_p02">Some marketers choose to partner with a search consultancy whose job is to conduct the search. They use different methods to determine which agencies are the most appropriate fit for their client’s pitch. They also work as liaisons between the client and the competing agencies to handle questions and logistics and to structure the pitch.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s03_p01">The pitch process can be short or long, depending on the information the client requests in order to make the decision. There is usually a series of steps, including but not limited to these:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Filing the RFP</em>. A client will send out the RFP, which will include some basic background information and preliminary statements of what the agency will be tasked to solve.

            <li>

<em class="emphasis">Initial strategic thinking</em>. Before agencies are given a specific creative assignment, there is a step to discuss the approach to the problem. This discussion can sometimes be part of the chemistry meeting but can also be a next step. The initial strategic thinking allows the agency to demonstrate the tools it keeps in its shed without putting them all to use until the client agrees to the strategic approach.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Creative presentation</em>. If an agency is given a creative assignment, this meeting is where it presents its recommendations to the client.</li>

In a recent interview well-known account planner Jon Steel noted, “I have always believed that the best new business weapon in an agency’s armory is the quality and effectiveness of the work it produces for its existing clients.” However, another way that agencies have demonstrated their creative ability is to present “spec” (speculative) creative work in pitches. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Spec work</a><span class="glossdef">Preliminary ideas based on the agency’s best guess as to what might appeal to and work best for a client and presented in a form that is very close to “finished.”</span></span> is developed based on the agency’s best guess as to what might appeal to and work best for a client and presented in a form that is very close to “finished.”</p>

            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s03_p03">The problem with spec work is that many in the industry feel it devalues skills such as design, art direction, and copywriting—as it forces agencies to give away for free (or at a substantially reduced cost) their most valuable product: their creativity. In the end, ownership of the ideas presented during pitches can be contested; clients who have had a number of agencies pitch creative work have been known to pick and choose among the best of all the pitching agencies’ ideas while awarding the business to just one. As a result, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) created a Positioning Paper outlining best practice guidelines for the use of “spec” creative in the new business process: <a class="link" href="http://www.aaaa.org/eweb/upload/6712_att.pdf">http://www.aaaa.org/eweb/upload/6712_att.pdf</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="solomon-ch01_s03_s03_p05">You can’t work on an account until you’re awarded the business. To win a client you have to present a pitch, usually along with several other agencies. Although the client doesn’t (or shouldn’t) expect to see a finished campaign, it will look for evidence that your team has put a lot of creative thought and effort into fleshing out its vision of what the advertising will look like. Preparing a pitch can be an expensive, grueling, and nail-biting experience, so an agency shouldn’t throw its hat into the ring unless it’s willing to make a commitment to go all out in order to win the business.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s04_p02">Established in 1996 as a joint venture between Microsoft and the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), ten years later msnbc.com finds itself in an increasingly crowded field of news providers and hopes to add new users to its twenty-five million unique visitors a month. As msnbc.com’s VP of marketing, Catherine Captain, says, “I am particularly concerned about distinguishing ourselves in a market where every new site is starting to look a lot alike.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s04_p03">It is important to understand that the client is msnbc.com the Web site and <em class="emphasis">not</em> MSNBC the cable channel. Although the Web site msnbc.com and the cable channel MSNBC were launched together in 1996, they have always maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. NBC and Microsoft remain fifty-fifty partners in msnbc.com, but Microsoft has reduced its stake in the television network to 18 percent. And msnbc.com is editorially and financially separate from MSN, the portal site and online service operated by Microsoft, although it acts as that site’s primary news provider.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s04_p04">In addition to original content from its staff, which is based out of the newsroom in Redmond, Washington, msnbc.com is the news Web site for the NBC News family. It also features content from the cable television news channel MSNBC, NBC shows such as <em class="emphasis">Today, NBC Nightly News</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Dateline NBC</em>, and partners such as the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> and the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>. In addition, msnbc.com made its first acquisition in late 2007 when it bought Newsvine, a Web site with community-driven news stories and opinions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s04_p05">In its history as a company, msnbc.com never pursued or launched a branding campaign until Ms. Captain arrived just shy of the site’s tenth anniversary. In her quest for the right agency, Ms. Captain sent RFPs “to a whole slew of potential agencies.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s04_s02_p01">You can guess the outcome: Catherine Captain chose SS+K to reintroduce msnbc.com to the world. Her goal was to maximize the impact of her modest $7 million marketing budget. Instead of choosing an interactive agency, which she said would “predetermine her plan,” Captain preferred the “media-agnostic” approach of SS+K. And so, in March of 2006, a decade-old msnbc.com announced it would soon launch its first branding campaign.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch01_s04_s02_p02">The idea of integrated marketing communications has been around for a long time. But the independently held SS+K embraced the concept in a way that only people from a disparate number of camps could: there are no well-populated traditional territories in the agency. Instead, it is home for a multidisciplinary cast of communication experts as well as a collection of “formers”—former actors, scientists, journalists—galvanized by a combined passion for strategic innovation and, as Captain observes, challenging the status quo. There is no allegiance to method or medium; advertising doesn’t get preferential treatment over public relations or other buzz boosters.</p>
