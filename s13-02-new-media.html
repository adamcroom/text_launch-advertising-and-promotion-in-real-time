However, search ads can get pricey because bidding for coveted keywords can be fierce.

For example, the SciFi Channel keeps fans of <em class="emphasis">Battlestar Galactica</em> engaged by letting fans see the inner workings of the show. Executive producer Ronald Moore posts concept art, scripts, and outtakes on the Web site. “From the beginning, I wanted a very open policy; let’s put as much on the Internet as we can,” he said. Moore supports viewers who want to download parts of the show, right down to letting fans edit their own versions of the show.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_017">Quoted in “Inside the Mind of a Cyclon,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, November 2007, 27.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p04">Online ads support both specificity and tracking. “We can see what sites, pages, types of ads perform the best,” said Kathleen Cunningham, president of Advanced Marketing Strategies. She has found that the best way to use the Internet for client companies is to get e-mail addresses volunteered by customers of IKEA, for instance, and then put out occasional e-mails to them about in-store deals. “The trick is to not bombard them with e-mails,” Cunningham said.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_018">Quoted in Mark Larson, “Digital Format Presents Rubik’s Cube of Challenges to Advertisers,” <em class="emphasis">San Diego Business Journal</em>, July 9, 2007, 14.</span></p>

For example, Absolut brand vodka partnered with Free411, an ad-supported directory-assistance service. Free411 is just like the phone company’s service, except that it’s free. Each time the service’s forty-five thousand users called to get the number for a club or bar, they first heard a fifteen-second spot for Absolut’s new Pears vodka. Callers were then offered a drink recipe that would be text messaged to their cell phones to give to their bartender. Nearly two thousand callers said yes, which was roughly 4 percent of the total call volume. (That’s actually eight times the average response rate for such an offer.) The cost of the promotion was under $50,000.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_019">“The Results Issue,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 28.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p02">Cell phone advertising is still in its infancy in the United States, but it’s much more common in some other countries, especially those where a large number of people carry Web-enabled phones—in some parts of Europe this proportion is as high as three-fourths of the population. Some advertisers are skeptical about the future of m-commerce because they feel that many consumers will resist the practice of seeing a lot of ad messages clog up their phones. One recent survey reported that only 18 percent of American respondents said they were receptive to the idea of watching ads in exchange for free mobile content. But 37 percent of Europeans like the idea. And large numbers of respondents said they visited a Web site or requested more information about a product after seeing a mobile ad.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_020">Eric Pfanner, “Marketers Have Eyes on the ‘Third Screen,’” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, March 22, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/business/media/22adco.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/business/media/22adco.html</a> (accessed February 10, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p03">The pace of cell phone advertising is likely to pick up as more people get used to the idea of accessing content (other than IMs) on their mobiles. Already, major phone companies including Verizon Communications and AT&amp;T have signed deals to distribute programming—including <em class="emphasis">Saturday Night Live</em> clips and user-generated video—to cell phone customers along with ads to support this effort. Expect to see further integration of viewing platforms; even now AT&amp;T is working on a system to coordinate digital purchases so that when a customer buys a movie on his laptop, it’s instantly available for streaming to his cell phone and on-demand on his TV.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_021">Amol Sharma, “Phone Giants Roll Out ‘Three Screen’ Strategy: Video Programming and Ads to be Served on TV, Cell Phones, Web,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, June 26, 2008, B7.</span></p>

Today cell phone users can sign up to receive mobile coupons that offer discounts on products ranging from CDs and DVDs to fast food. To cash in the coupons, consumers show their cell phone screen that displays the coupon to a store cashier. Virgin Megastores, Hollywood Video, Domino’s Pizza, and Quiznos Subs participate in this program, and about one million people have signed up for the service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_022">Stephanie Kang, “Coupons Gain New Market on Cell Phones,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, September 11, 2007, B8.</span></p>

Sound far-fetched? For now, yes—but probably not for long. The exciting evolution of GPS technology creates the capability for advertisers to beam coupons to phone users depending on their location. In one early test of this method, Coupon CBS partnered with the social networking service Loopt, which already allows its subscribers to track participating friends. Ads appear on two Web sites tailored for mobile devices, CBS Mobile News and CBS Mobile Sports.

What is new, however, is that product placement has evolved from a practice of convenience (directors like to include actual products as props to enhance realism) to a deliberate and lucrative business practice. A typical placement deal between Staples and NBC illustrates how this works: when the office products retailer introduced a new paper-shredder called the MailMate in 2006, it engaged a company that specializes in placements to handle this part of its media strategy. The company made a deal with the producers of <em class="emphasis">The Office</em> to include the product in two episodes of the hit show. In one show, the character Kevin Malone shreds paper with the MailMate; in the second, the character Dwight Schrute leaves the company and takes a job at Staples. To emphasize the small size of the paper shredder, it sat on Kevin’s desk. To show how sturdy it is, he shredded his plastic credit card with the device. And the episode closed with Kevin shredding lettuce to make a salad; when a colleague asked where he got the salad, he replied, “Staples.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_029">Stephanie Clifford, “Product Placements Acquire a Life of Their Own on Shows,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 14, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a> (accessed July 14, 2008).</span> Nothing subtle about that placement.</p>

Purpose-built advergames “let you have complete control over your brand message since you’re the one making the game,” said Darren Herman, the cofounder of IGA Worldwide. “But the biggest problem with advergames is in their distribution. Most companies don’t have the resources of, say, a Burger King, to do that correctly. For every successful advergame—like Burger King’s—there’s a ton of failures, usually due to distribution. How do you get your game out there and who do you get it to?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_032">Quoted in Paul Hyman, “Burger King Has It Their Way with Advergame Sales,” <em class="emphasis">Hollywood Reporter</em>, February 7, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/features/columns/playing.../e3i19a1b95e867baa55b5c3c3c6d5061b53">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/features/columns/playing.../e3i19a1b95e867baa 55b5c3c3c6d5061b53</a> (accessed February 10, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s04_p03">Herman raises a valid point, but videogames seem poised to become a distribution platform in their own right. As gaming becomes more of a mainstream activity, we can expect to see more advertising targeted to players. While many media planners still have a stereotype of a typical gamer as a greasy-haired teenager who eats a lot of cold pizza, the reality is that 40 percent of gamers are women, and the average age of game players is thirty-five. And 65 percent of American households play computer and video games.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s01_s04_p04">As the tip of the iceberg, MTV recently announced that the sequel to its popular Rock Band game (Rock Band 2, not surprisingly) will include a track from the first Guns N’ Roses album in more than a decade. As a music industry executive observed about the potential of videogames to sell music products, “These games absolutely have an impact because the opportunity to hear these songs on radio is dwindling. This is becoming an important piece of the marketing puzzle.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_033">Quoted in Robert Levine, “Planned Guns N’ Roses Deal Underscores Power of Video Games to Sell Songs,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 22, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a> (accessed July 22, 2008).</span></p>

How did this low-budget production pull this off? The answer is the buzz campaign that began long before the film was released. While the story of a group of young people who get massacred in the woods was fiction (sorry to burst the bubble), the producers cleverly perpetuated the idea that the movie was a true documentary. By the time the film actually was released, it had built an avid following.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Virtual Worlds</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p01">The Internet has spawned numerous virtual worlds in which people take the form of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">avatars</a><span class="glossdef">Digital representations of people.</span></span> (digital representations of themselves) as they play, interact, and virtually live in an online space. Some communities, such as Linden Lab’s Second Life, mimic real life with 3-D graphics that give people a chance to live a different identity (or several) online. Many users choose elaborate characters, either fantasy figures or idealized men or women with exaggerated “attributes.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p02">Numerous companies have set up shop in one or more of these virtual worlds. In some cases (as in advergaming) they simply advertise their product on virtual billboards. For example, billboards in Second Life advertise the Honda Acura RDX. Clicking on the billboard gives the user a virtual copy of the car that they can drive around Second Life and even use in racing games in the online world. In other (typically more successful) cases the brand becomes part of the world, as when avatars who receive virtual Nikes actually get the ability to run faster in the virtual world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p03">Currently well over a hundred virtual worlds are operating live or are in development. The research firm Gartner predicts that by the year 2011, over 250 million people will be involved in these immersive digital environments. U.S. firms spent an estimated $15 million on advertising in virtual worlds in 2006. This figure is expected to reach $150 million by 2012.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p04">To date, virtual worlds have received a lukewarm reception by advertisers. Some early campaigns fizzled because they failed to generate interest among virtual world inhabitants—simply putting up a billboard just won’t do it for most avatars. In other cases, disappointed clients didn’t see the kinds of numbers they are used to getting from real-world campaigns that might touch millions of people. This platform is still in its infancy, so many consumers don’t even know yet that it exists.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s03_p05">This is a very short-sighted perspective: virtual worlds will most likely continue to mature and evolve into a major media platform over the next five or ten years. Major media companies, including MTV Networks and Disney, continue to invest millions of dollars as they develop their own virtual worlds. Media planners who doubt the staying power of these platforms need look only to the next generation of consumers, who already are logging serious time in their own virtual worlds. Habbo Hotel (based in Finland) targets thirteen- to eighteen-year-olds and boasts over 100 million registered users worldwide and over 8.5 million unique users each month. Gaia Online attracts more than 2 million unique visitors each month; $300,000 of the members log in for an average of <em class="emphasis">two hours</em> <em class="emphasis">per day</em>. You heard it here first: virtual worlds are the future of advertising.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_p01">What if you could get your customers to make your ads for you? In a twist to the old practice of using customer testimonials, companies are giving customers the power and the tools to make their own ads, a phenomenon known as consumer-generated media (CGM). The rise of PC video and image editing tools means that millions have the ability to create content. For example, snack-maker Doritos posted media clips online for consumers to tweak and make a commercial for the product, with the winning commercial being aired during the Super Bowl. The company received over a hundred entries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_036">Sonia Reyes, “Packaged Foods” <em class="emphasis">Adweek</em>, April 30, 2007, SR19.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_p02">Other companies, like McDonald’s, found user-created video on YouTube. “The whole idea behind the ‘I’m lovin’ it’ campaign is that it’s from the consumers’ point of view, and what better way to show that than with these two guys who did their own video? Since our target has a very keen bull** meter…it gives a different perspective on McDonald’s, making it seem [less] corporate,” said Chris Arnold, creative director for Arnold Worldwide, who handles some McDonald’s work in New York and purchased the rights to make the video into a spot for McDonald’s.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_037">Quoted in “The Results Issue,” <em class="emphasis">Brandweek</em>, July 23, 2007, 28.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_p03">But what if some ads insult the brand? When Chevy let consumers make ads about its new Chevy Tahoe, some consumers created ads attacking the large SUV’s gas-guzzling ways. But Chevy didn’t remove the negative submissions, because it showed that the brand could take a good-natured teasing and stay open to customer’s opinions. Besides, everyone knows there are trolls on the Internet, so negative content is often ignored. Chevy Tahoe found that despite (or because of) the full range of ads, consumers did visit the site and did visit the car dealers’ showrooms in response.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_p04">Of course, there are limits to what’s acceptable. For example, liquor makers need to promote sensible drinking habits, which homemade videos may not convey. “For the liquor industry, any user content has to meet regulations and standards,” said Mike Church, media director for Diageo PLC, which owns brands Smirnoff and Guinness, among others.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_038">Quoted in “Brand Building in the Digital Age: A Dizzying Array of Choices,” <em class="emphasis">Knowledge@Wharton</em>, April 11, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu">http://www.knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu</a> (accessed July 28, 2008).</span> Procter &amp; Gamble, the nation’s largest advertiser, invites viewers to help decide what is acceptable: it set up an option on its main consumer toll-free line in response to a drive from a coalition, dubbed Enough Is Enough, that was urging the company to stop sponsoring hip-hop programs on MTV and BET laced with profanity and scenes the group believes degrade and objectify women.

        <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_p05">When the inmates take over the asylum, there’s bound to be resistance: a lot of advertisers aren’t happy about giving up control of their brand messages. According to results of a survey released by Accenture, media and entertainment executives see the ability and eagerness of individuals to create their own content as one of the biggest <em class="emphasis">threats</em> to their business. As the saying goes, however, when it comes to CGM, “you’re either on the train or under it.” Surveys show that in a typical month about half of all online users either create user-generated content (UGC) or read items posted by others.

The gamers eventually will be given the opportunity to persuade the company to produce their drink in the real world. An executive boasted, “To the best of our knowledge, a brand has never given consumers this much control. We felt that the best way to fully engage consumers would be to give them the power to create a new product.”</p>

Microsoft already sells and manages display advertisements on Facebook, but the additional search function could allow the software giant to catch up to Google (which provides search on MySpace) and Yahoo! (which does the same for Bebo) in the search business. More than twenty-nine million people actively use Facebook in the United States; soon they will see Microsoft’s Live Search box on Facebook pages.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_049">Brad Stone and Miguel Helft, “Microsoft Seeks an Ad Friend in Facebook,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Online</em>, July 25, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/business/media/25adco.html?ref=media">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/business/media/25adco.html?ref=media</a> (accessed February 10, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_s04_p01">New media is still a baby in the media world, so there’s a lot of trial and error going on out there (as well as some dirty diapers). Although many marketers may have theories about what <em class="emphasis">should</em> work, the nature of new media means that these theories largely are untested. Consumer acceptance, response, and cost effectiveness can all be unknown. In some cases advertisers find themselves in uncomfortable territory, such as when their online banner ad inadvertently appears on a pornographic site, a Web page belonging to a hate group, or a blog critical of the advertiser.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_s04_p02">Privacy issues, combined with the fact that consumers have only so much free time, also could damp the boom in social networking on the Web. “Nobody has 5,000 real friends,” says Tim Hanlon, senior vice president of Denuo Group, a media and advertising consulting firm owned by Publicis. “At the end of the day it just becomes one big cauldron of noise.” For marketers, he says, that will mean the sites will be much more effective as a consumer research tool than as a venue to peddle products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-solomon-fn10_050">Suzanne Vranica, “Ad Houses Will Need to Be More Nimble; Clients are Demanding More and Better Use of Consumer Data, Web,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, January 2, 2008, B3.</span> Log onto your Facebook page to see what your friends have to say about <em class="emphasis">that</em>.</p>

                <p class="para" id="solomon-ch10_s02_s04_s04_p03">New media offers the advertiser a chance to be a pioneer and to push the company’s brand in new directions. These platforms lets brands stay hip and fresh to reach younger audiences and to create buzz when news outlets cover the innovation. And because the new media are untried, they may be cheaper on a per-impression basis than traditional media. But handle with care.</p>
